### Welcome!

**The goal of our club is to build a welcoming environment to learn and discuss different aspects of the science behind what makes people happier - as well as to create a space for like-minded students to get to know each other. Let's all learn how to live our best, happiest lives together! All UO students are welcome!**

### Our Club is associated with BI 170: Happiness - A Neuroscience and Psychology Perspective

**BI 170: Happiness - A Neuroscience and Psychology Perspective** is offered each Fall Term at the University of Oregon and is taught by the club's faculty advisor, Professor David A. McCormick. The course offers a science-based curriculum with practical strategies on how to live "the good life".
