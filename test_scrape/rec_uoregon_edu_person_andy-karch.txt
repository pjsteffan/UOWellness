He came here from Ole Miss in a similar role and has worked with all types of fitness and health populations, from Division I athletes to individuals with Parkinson’s disease and other cognitive impairments. Growing up in Wisconsin, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master’s degree from the University of Florida. His drive to help others find modes of exercise, fitness, and movement they enjoy makes working for PE and Rec a perfect fit. Whether it’s CrossFit, pumping iron, running, swimming, hiking, gardening, or playing with your kids, everyone can find something to keep them active and healthy! When not at the Rec, Andy likes long and challenging backpacking and hiking trips into the backcountry wilderness (North Cascades up next), landscape and cheese photography, playing video games, reading, cooking, and traveling.
