Contact Chantelle Russell for further information. Fees Activity classes cost $105. Some classes such as scuba and outdoor pursuits require additional fees for gear, transportation, and certification. Activity classes are assessed a fee because they are not funded by tuition and general fees. Class fees cover the cost of instruction, equipment, administration, and facility maintenance. Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
