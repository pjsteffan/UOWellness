Durable medical equipment (DME) refers to the devices that can help support your injured body part and assist in your recovery. What DME do you have in stock in the Sports Medicine clinic? Our extensive list of in-house DME provides you quick access to support. Our DME prices are cost comparable (if not cheaper) than over-the-counter products. The following is not a complete list, but are examples of equipment we stock: Insoles Foot and ankle braces Calf, knee, and thigh braces Spine and shoulder braces Elbow and wrist braces Finger splints Cold packs Taping supplies Exercise equipment Miscellaneous therapy items How do I know what DME I need for my injury? DME can be prescribed by a medical provider at UHS. Please schedule an appointment in the Sports Medicine clinic for your musculoskeletal needs. We have providers who can recommend specific equipment and provide customized fitting for your body and injury. The best way to schedule a Sports Medicine Clinic appointment is to call 541-346-0565. What else do I need to know? Please check with your insurance provider if DME is covered by your plan. Most plans will cover 20–50 percent of the charge of the DME cost, but each plan can be different. Some plans apply DME cost to your deductible. We have a list of DME equipment with cash prices that can be reviewed prior to purchase and distribution. You can get your insurance questions answered by contacting 541-346-2770.
