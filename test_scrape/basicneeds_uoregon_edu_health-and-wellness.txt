Dispensers can be found in almost all restrooms, regardless of gender, and supplies are free. Menstrual hygiene is recognized as a public health issue. In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3294 , the Menstrual Dignity Act, to alleviate some of the economic strain and experiences of shame that often are barriers for menstruating students accessing their education. For more information about the state Menstrual Dignity for Students Program, go to the State of Oregon website and scroll to the bottom of the page.
