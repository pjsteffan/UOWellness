For care providers who are not registered/certified in the state where care will be provided, you will need to submit background check documentation. UO Childcare Subsidy staff will accept background checks conducted by any legitimate agency or through any legitimate registry. Participants commonly use the process provided by the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the Oregon State Police . This process is detailed below. Background check arrangements are the responsibility of the program participant. Additionally, program applicants or their provider must pay any upfront costs associated with completing a background check. Applicants may apply for the Care-Finding Fund to be reimbursed, subject to limitations. Full guidelines can be found at basicneeds.uoregon.edu/eligibility-guidelines .
