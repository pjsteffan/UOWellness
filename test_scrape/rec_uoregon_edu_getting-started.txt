All workouts will open to reserve your spot exactly one week in advance. 30 minutes prior to class starting, online check-in will close. Drop-ins will still be welcome if class capacity has not been filled at the time of class starting. To support your warm-up safety, upon class starting, any spot reserved online that is not present will be dropped, and stand-by patrons will be able to take your spot. No one will be allowed to enter class once it has started. You can release your reserved spot two or more hours prior to class starting with no penalty. Releasing your spot less than two hours prior to class will document in our check in platform as a no show. Not showing up for a class you pre-registered for will document in our check in platform as a no show. After two no shows, any additional no show will incur a $12.00 charge for EACH ADDITIONAL class missed. The total charges will be processed at the end of the current term to your student account and communicated via email. The purpose of utilizing online check-in is to SUPPORT your accountability and trust that you have a safe and secure workout space to move as we plan to grow our programs for all Ducks.
