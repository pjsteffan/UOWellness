Colds, flu, COVID-19 and allergies can often have very similar and overlapping symptoms. Getting plenty of rest, fluids and nutritious foods are the best ways to support your immune system when you are sick. Antibiotics do not treat colds, flu, COVID-19, seasonal allergies, or most sore throats. There are many over the counter medications that can help increase your comfort during your illness, but they do not specifically treat the virus. The table below provides some basic information regarding common illness symptoms, but doesn’t definitively diagnose your illness. Contact University Health Services if you feel you need further evaluation or testing. COVID-19, influenza A and B, and strep pharyngitis are illnesses which can be confirmed by testing in our clinic.
