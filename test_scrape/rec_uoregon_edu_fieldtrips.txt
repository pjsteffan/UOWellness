If you would like to be added to the newsletter contact list, please reach out to ducktrails@uoregon.edu . Our summer Duck Trails sessions include optional field trips that take place during the camp day. Campers will be transported to locations in university vehicles by van-certified camp counselors to enjoy hours of fun off campus. Field trips are open to all campers (unless otherwise specified below) that are registered for a Duck Trails camp in that same session. Field trips are not available to junior counselors. Trips will take place after lunch so as not to interfere with programmed time in the morning. Campers may miss swim on a field trip day. If the field trip you are interested in is full, families can add their campers directly to the waitlists. Please proceed to the online registration on RecWeb , log in with your account, and all full trips will have a "Waitlist" button.
