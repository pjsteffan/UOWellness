You can walk from one side of campus to the other in less than 15 minutes. If you want to check on that, the interactive campus map can tell you exactly how long it takes to get from place to place. We also love our bikes—commuter bikes, mountain bikes, tandem bikes, and even scooters (which are technically not bikes). If you don't have a bike, visit a local bike shop to purchase one. You can also check out the UO Bike Program to use the free do-it-yourself maintenance workspace, attend a class, or go on a bike ride. If you use a bike here at the UO, make sure you know how to lock it up properly with a U-lock. And don’t forget to register your bike with Transportation Services in case your bike is ever stolen or you lose the key and need help removing your lock. When you want to go out in the Eugene community, take the bus! As a UO student you get free bus access from Lane Transit District (LTD). There’s a rapid transit line—the EmX—that runs right by campus on its way between downtown Eugene and downtown Springfield. If you need to get to or from campus at night, you can use Duck Rides , a student-funded program that provides transportation to students throughout the Eugene community. However you travel, be safe.
