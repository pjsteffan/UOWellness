That’s why Financial Aid and Scholarships offers resources to help you get better at managing your finances. Check out the Financial Wellness Center for information on how to spend, budget, and borrow smart. Legal Issues Even though we hope that you never have any legal issues while on campus, sometimes things happen. ASUO Legal Services is a student-funded office that provides legal advice and representation to UO students. Legal Services specializes in issues that you might have as a student, like traffic accidents and landlord disputes. To see a lawyer, all you have to do is make an appointment. If you need advice about an issue that involves a person or office affiliated with UO, you should contact the Office of Student Advocacy . They can help you navigate the student conduct process, dispute a grade, or understand Oregon residency rules. Contact the office to set up an appointment.
