Basic Needs Assistance Form This form is not intended for reporting urgent matters. For a list of crisis resources, visit dos.uoregon.edu/help . Basic Needs Syllabus Statement If you are a faculty member or graduate employee, consider adding a basic needs security statement to your syllabus to let students know what resources are available to them on campus. Sample language: Being able to meet your basic needs is foundational to your success as a student at the University of Oregon. If you are having difficulty affording food, lack a stable place to live, or are struggling to meet another need, please contact the Basic Needs Program at https://basicneeds.uoregon.edu for information on how to get support.
