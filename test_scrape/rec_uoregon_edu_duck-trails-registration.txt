Online Registration For your convenience, we encourage you to take advantage of our online registration system. UO affiliates can log in with a Duck ID and password. UO alumni and community members will need to create an account through our Online Access Request Form . Completing this form is the only way to ensure that you receive the correct pricing for each camper. Therefore, all affiliations should complete the form the first time you register or when adding family members to your household. You will be contacted within two business days with your login credentials or account update. The online registration portal can be found on RecWeb . Additionally, we have reconfigured how you select your desired camps. From now on, you will be registering directly into the group your child will be in based on the grade they are entering in the fall. If you are coordinating with other families, registering for the same group based on grade means that your children will be together all day. If you have questions about your child’s eligibility for a specific camp program, please contact us at ducktrails@uoregon.edu. Payment Duck Trails Camps have a three-tier price structure, with discounted prices for UO affiliates (faculty members, staff, and students) and UO alumni. Proof of affiliation is required to receive the discounted price. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. We accept Visa, Mastercard, payroll deduction (UO faculty/staff only) and UO charge. Registration for week-long programming cannot be pro-rated or offered for individual days. Most school-year programming are single day registrations. UO Students All Duck Trails Camp programs are UO Childcare Subsidy eligible . UO Affiliates (Faculty/Staff) Looking to spread out camp payments? When you sign up for camp in March, you may have your payment broken down into equal monthly installments through the months of April, May, and June by opting to pay using payroll deduction (only available in person at the Welcome Desk). The minimum amount for a payroll deduction is $100. Refunds Once you complete registration, your reservations are considered final. If you would like a refund, it must be requested no later than two weeks prior to the first day of the session for which your child is registered. All refunds incur a non-refundable processing fee of $25. To request a refund, email ducktrails@uoregon.edu . No refunds will be issued if requested after the two-week deadline. We cannot process refunds for incorrect pricing after your payment has been made. If you are not receiving the correct pricing based on your affiliation, please do not move forward with payment and contact us immediately at ducktrails@uoregon.edu . Transfers If you need to switch your camper from one session to another, you may request a transfer up to two weeks prior to the first day of the session in which your child is enrolled. Transfer requests may be made by contacting ducktrails@uoregon.edu . Transfers are not guaranteed and requests will only be approved if there is a spot available in the desired camp. Waitlists Once a camp fills, you may request to have your child added to the camp waitlist. Families can add their campers directly to the waitlists. Please proceed to the online registration link, log in with your account, and all full sessions will have a "Waitlist" button. If space becomes available in that camp, we will contact you according to waitlist order. Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
