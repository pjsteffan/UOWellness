Swim, Fun, and Safety Play will be experiential and safety-oriented swim sessions for swimmers of all abilities. We will not be teaching strokes in this course. It will be the same program for both sessions. May 13 is the only date for 18 months to 3 years. We ask that you only sign up for one session to allow as many families as possible to participate. The focus will be on water comfort, floating, moving through the water, and safety. We will have stations focused on different skills for the swimmers to work through. There will be instructors available and circulating throughout the stations. Parent participation in the water encouraged for all ages and abilities – you will learn ways to work with your child/children in the water. Parent participation required for younger children who cannot stand in the Rec Pool with their face above water. Our goal is to provide an active, experiential, fun, learning experience for all. Please contact Jackie Cowan James for more information. When and where are the lessons, and how long do they last? Spring classes will take place on Saturdays.
