Register for credit classes on DuckWeb just as you would for academic courses. Up to 12 PE credits will count towards general education requirements. If a class you would like to take is full, email the instructor or attend the first meeting and talk to the instructor about the possibility of enrolling. However, some classes such as group cycling cannot be over-enrolled. PE classes can also be taken for non-credit as activity classes . Syllabi Instructors will provide specific syllabi for individual classes. However, the following master syllabus details policies and procedures that apply to all classes. Read through the master syllabus before beginning your class. Master Syllabus Format Most PE classes meet twice a week for one-credit and are usually graded pass/no pass. The majority of class time is spent actively moving. We also offer several lecture-based classes such as Coaching, Women and Sport, Nutrition and Performance, and Personal Training and Group Fitness Instructor Preparation. Accessibility Students of all abilities are welcome to participate in Physical Education courses. Students can work with the Accessible Education Center (AEC) and instructors for appropriate accommodations. The AEC can assist students in finding an aide or interpreter if needed to participate in PE courses. PE and Rec will waive the course fee for the aide. Contact Chantelle Russell for further information. Fees The PE class fee is $87 per credit. Some classes such as scuba and outdoor pursuits require additional fees for gear, transportation, and certification. PE classes are assessed a fee because they are not funded by tuition and general fees. Class fees cover the cost of instruction, equipment, administration, and facility maintenance. Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
