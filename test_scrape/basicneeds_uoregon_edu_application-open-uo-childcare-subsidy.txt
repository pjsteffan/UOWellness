Information has been clarified about international student eligibility for need-based US federal and state programs, related documentation, and circumstances when participation in a federal or state program is not required to be eligible for this subsidy. The Care-Finding Fund has been created to reimburse expenses that a student incurs to find a provider or secure a background check, including any background checks that may be required for this subsidy.

Once a student is admitted to the program, they will continue to meet the income qualification requirement for the duration of the program year.

They can submit a Childcare Subsidy Change Form when they wish to add a child, partner/spouse/co-parent, or provider. Oregon Health Plan (OHP) has been added as a program to satisfy the income qualification requirement. Situations have been clarified about when an applicant may need to submit a copy of a provider background check document for the provider to be approved for reimbursement.
