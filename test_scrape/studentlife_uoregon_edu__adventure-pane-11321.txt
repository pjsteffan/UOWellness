Connect. Discover. Your college experience is not just a degree. It is learning to be a leader. It is joining a club. It is stepping out of your comfort zone and seeing the world with a new perspective. The full college experience is defined by the connections and memories that you make outside of the classroom. The Division of Student Life is here to provide you with those opportunities. The path you take as a Duck is up to you, but the services and opportunities will help you along the way. Define what it means to be a Duck!
