Rushadicus August 3 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall | ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU | Rushadicus (Rushad Eggleston) is a cellist provocateur and a performance artist. After a formal music education, his work in the bluegrass, Americana and rock worlds garnered awards and international recognition, yet failed to fulfill his goblin heart. Over a three-year period, Rushadicus developed “Sneth Metal”—a new sound that defies all expectations, logic and form. It’s virtuoso improvisation and wild, immersive theater. It’s hilarious. It’s deeply disturbing. It’s great art that rejects the traditional forms of music and deconstructs the very idea of entertainment. It is one of the most unforgettable solo shows you will ever witness.

Jerry Joseph August 10 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall | ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU | Jerry Joseph is a musician who lives in Portland Oregon, but he’s often gone. He’s been inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame but is still rather obscure to a lot of people. He plays well over 150 shows a year in the usual places. Across America. Sometimes in Europe, Mexico, and Central America. Then there’s these other places he plays—Lebanon, Israel, Kurdish Iraq, India, and Afghanistan. All over the Middle East, often in war zones and refugee camps.
In addition to his touring, Jerry has set up a non-profit called Nomad Music Foundation that acts as a sort of School of Rock for displaced teenagers in areas of conflict. So far, he has taken guitars and taught lessons in camps in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Sulaymaniyah and Dahuk, both in Kurdish Iraq. These life-changing missions have been written up in Rolling Stone, Relix, and PBS News Hour.
A triple threat—someone who works at the highest levels as a songwriter, singer, and player. Jason Isbell, who kinda personifies such, recently tweeted about triple threats and listed Jerry Joseph (along with Richard Thompson and St. Vincent) among the greatest examples of that phenomenon.

William Clark Green August 17 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall | ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU | In the proudly independent Texas-country scene, it’s not easy to separate yourself – or to evolve once you have. But for almost 15 years, William Clark Green has done both with a nod to his home state itself, both rooted in the past and barreling toward the future. Boasting sandpaper vocals and country-rock sound at the crossroads of back-alley grit and gravel-road grace, the Flint, Texas, native emerged like many others before – sauntering out from Lubbock’s live music loving college-bar scene. But he has since carved a space that is uniquely his own. Invite my friends Add to my calendar Aug 18 Growing Pains, Grumpster, IX of Swords 8:00 p.m. |ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU|

Growing Pains, Grumpster, IX of Swords August 18 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall | ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU | Playwright Antonin Artaud once wrote: “I abandon myself to the fever of dreams, in search for new laws.” For Portland-based indie quartet Growing Pains, the dream world is where apathy ends, and euphoria begins. For six years, Growing Pains have mastered the art of surrendering to the dream, embracing it, and returning with songs to prove it. Since 2018, Growing Pains have been writing and performing blue-tinted indie rock, spritzed with emo, power pop, and shoegaze influences.

Guttermouth August 21 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall | ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU | Formed in Huntington Beach, California in 1988, Guttermouth was heavily influenced by the Southern California punk rock scenes of the 1980s which spawned bands such as the Adolescents, The Vandals, Social Distortion, Fear, Descendents, Angry Samoans, Bad Religion and Black Flag. The band took these influences and developed their own style of fast, punk tempos with humorously sarcastic and offensive lyrics coupled with equally outrageous and offensive behavior, developing a reputation for chaotic live shows. Guttermouth is the perfect blend of what California-based punk rock is all about, one of the seminal bands in the US skate-punk scene.

Peter Antoniou September 12 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU From London’s West End, to being a semi-finalist on America’s Got Talent, Peter Antoniou has been astounding audiences around the world with his uncanny abilities. His shows fuse stunning feats of mind-reading with storytelling, razor sharp wit, and improvisational comedy to create unique live entertainment experiences. Funny, engaging, and interactive, Peter will leave you questioning just what is really possible. Aged nine, Peter decided he wanted superpowers. So, in a way only a child can, he set out to learn the impossible: how to read people’s minds. Twenty years later, he has studied with psychologists, hypnotists, psychics, magicians, and shamans to develop his uncanny and unique abilities. Combined with a background in improvisational comedy, Peter answers the question, “What if, rather than starting X-men, Professor X pursued a career in entertainment?” Invite my friends Add to my calendar Sep 13 Traveling Wilburys Revue 8:00 p.m. ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU

The National Parks September 28 8:00 p.m. WOW Hall ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU On Saturday, Sept. 28th the Community Center for the Performing Arts proudly welcomes The National Parks to the WOW Hall. "The Provo, UT quartet—Brady Parks [vocals, guitar], Sydney Macfarlane [vocals, keys], Cam Brannelly [drums], and Megan Parks [violin]—breathe in inspiration from the world around them and exhale cinematic indie folk-pop powered by soaring harmonies, organic orchestration, and luminous electronics. Emerging in 2013, the musicians have consistently captivated audiences.They have generated over 150 million streams across Young [2013], Until I Live [2015], Places [2017], and Wildflower [2020]. As one of many highlights from the latter, “Time” amassed over 9.3 million Spotify streams as the album incited widespread critical applause. Parade raved, “Wildflower is chock full of adventure, wonder, freedom, and inspiration,” while The Line Of Best Fit attested, “it seems that the sky really is the limit for this quartet.” Mxdwn noted, “The National Parks have perfectly melded folk with catchy melodies, strong grunge chords and poetic lyrics in Wildflower.”The four-piece maintained this momentum with a sold-out headline tour and 2021’s A Mix for the End of the World pt.1. Now, the group expand their vision yet again on their fifth full-length offering, 8th Wonder."

I’m gonna win,’” she recalls, laughing. “Then I woke up to a bunch of comments on TikTok being like, ‘Oh my God, release this.
