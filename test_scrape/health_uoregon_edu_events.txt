                        Amphitheater https://blogs.uoregon.edu/women/ The Women’s Center is beyond excited to invite you to join *in-person* at our annual Take Back the Night Rally, March and Speak-Out Against Sexual and Domestic Violence. When: Take Back the Night is on Thursday, April 25th, 2024 starting with the Rally at 6:00pm followed by the March at 7:00pm and Student-Led Speak-Out at 8pm. Where: Rally begins in the EMU Amphitheater at 13th and University St. followed by an approximately 2.5 mile March from the UO Campus through the streets of Eugene and back to UO Campus in the EMU Diamond Lake Room where the Student-Led Speak Out is held. Who: The UO Women’s Center in collaboration with the UO Campus Community (UO Muxeres, UO Duck Rides, UO Green and Yellow Garter Band and more). Thursday, April 25th, 2024 marks the 46th annual Take Back the Night Rally, March and Speak-Out Against Sexual and Domestic Violence event for the University of Oregon Campus Community. Take Back the Night is a yearly international protest founded in 1976 which seeks to raise awareness about the realities of Sexual and Domestic Violence on campus and in the community, both for Survivors of Sexual and Domestic Violence and those who want to support and bear witness in solidarity. Take Back the Night is a Survivor-Centered event that begins with a Rally in the EMU Amphitheater, continues as a March through the streets of Eugene to symbolize reclaiming people’s safety on public streets at night, and ends with a Student-Led Speak-Out on campus during which Survivors can share personal stories of how Sexual and Domestic Violence has impacted their lives. The Rally will feature UO Student Speakers from diverse intersecting identities and lived experiences, including the Native American Community, Latine Community, LGBTQIA2S+ Community, International Community, Disabled Community, a Child Abuse Prevention Advocacy Organization and more. Our theme for this year’s event is addressing the DUALITY that Survivors can hold on their path to healing - throughout both their radical joy & rightful rage - as they ultimately reclaim their power. As well, we will continue to center marginalized communities too often left out of essential dialogue about Sexual and Domestic Violence - despite being disproportionately impacted by these systems of oppression. As always, the Women’s Center is committed to providing this essential event to support Survivors, educate the community and prevent future harm. ASL Interpretation will be provided at the Rally. This event is wheelchair accessible and will have transportation available during the March and back to Student-Led Speak-Out. We ask that no UO Professional Staff or Media be present during the Student Led Speak-Out portion of the event to provide a sacred space for students to have dialogue circles of peer-to-peer support. Event will take place **rain or shine** (rain is currently forecast) and is free and open to the public. We support and believe survivors in ALL WEATHER! Masks are not required but highly encouraged. Questions regarding Take Back the Night should be directed to Fatima Roohi Pervaiz or Maggie Bertrand at the UO Women’s Center.
