Our campus can be difficult to navigate on your own, and we are here to help. We will help you understand next steps, make appropriate referrals, and locate on- and off-campus resources. We can be reached via email, phone, or at our drop-in office hours. What We Cover Our advocate team works hard to help students understand university procedures and possible outcomes, yet all decisions rest with the student client. We seek to empower students to make the best possible decisions for their individual circumstances and needs, and to help them clearly define and understand the steps they need to take to obtain their desired outcomes. We do not guide, advise, or advocate on behalf of the student client, nor are there any mandated outcomes as a result of a meeting with a peer advocate. In a meeting with the peer advocates, we will try to determine a few things: What do you want? What do you need? What have you already tried? Then, we will help make a plan to achieve your goals. We won’t tell you what to do. Instead, we’ll help you figure out the best options to meet your own goals. When you leave, you’ll have clearly defined steps to take, people to speak to, and the right language to use in order to get what you want. And if you need a higher level of support, like someone to attend those meetings with you, we can provide that as well! Our staff attorney can do direct advocacy, which means they can come with you to meetings or take actions on your behalf.

Peer advocates are classified as Assisting Employees for all forms of prohibited discrimination. This means the peer advocates are only required to report child abuse and threats of imminent harm. If a student discloses prohibited discrimination, peer advocates will ensure that the student has information about support resources available on campus so that the student is empowered to make their own choices regarding their disclosure.
