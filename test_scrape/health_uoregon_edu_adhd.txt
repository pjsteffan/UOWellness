However, University Health Services does not provide new evaluations for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), nor do we routinely prescribe or refill medications for ADHD. If you are taking medications for ADHD prescribed elsewhere, we encourage you to continue your treatment relationship with your own prescribing clinician. Outside prescriptions, however, can be filled at the UHS pharmacy . ADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder with symptoms and impairment that begin in childhood. Making an accurate diagnosis of ADHD is complicated and time-consuming. Many ADHD symptoms occur frequently in other, more common, psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep deprivation, and substance abuse. Most attention difficulties in college students are due to disorders or problems other than ADHD. A proper evaluation requires a comprehensive interview; data from parents, teachers, and school records; and sometimes psycho-educational testing. During the evaluation, information is gathered about developmental, educational, psychiatric, medical, substance abuse, and family histories. The evaluation is also designed to rule out other mental health conditions that might be causing symptoms. The UO provides resources for students who have problems with study skills, time management, organization, and procrastination, which can be barriers to academic success. The Tutoring and Academic Engagement Center offers courses, workshops, individual appointments, math and writing labs, tutoring, and study skills coaching. In addition, throughout the year there are wellness workshops on topics such as test anxiety, transition to university-level work, and procrastination, among others. The Accessible Education Center offers individual and group advising for students with a prior confirmed diagnosis of ADHD or a learning disorder, as well as other disabilities. Learning Disability (LD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) services are available through the HEDCO Clinic in the College of Education. If you want to pursue a formal evaluation for ADHD or a learning disorder, there are several local psychologists who perform thorough assessments and provide psychosocial treatments. There are also a number of psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners in the community who will evaluate and offer medication treatment for ADHD, when appropriate. If you have additional questions regarding mental health services at University Health Services in general or regarding ADHD in particular, call our Mental Health Access Team at 541-346-3227.
