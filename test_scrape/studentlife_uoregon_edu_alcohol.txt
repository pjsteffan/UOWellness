The Division of Student Life is committed to addressing high-risk drinking behavior and drug use so that our community can be free of the potentially harmful and dangerous effects of alcohol and drug misuse. Student Conduct Code We expect you to follow the Student Conduct Code at all times, as well as state law, both of which prohibit alcohol consumption and cannabis use by people under the age of 21. The Student Conduct Code does apply to you off campus. As a University of Oregon student you are a Duck on and off campus, and your behavior should reflect that at all times. Alcohol Poisoning You should call 9-1-1 if you see someone exhibiting behavior that might indicate they have alcohol poisoning. Symptoms might look like the following: Cold, clammy, pale or bluish skin Unconscious or unable to be woken up Vomiting repeatedly or uncontrollably Slow or irregular breathing After calling 9-1-1 place the individual on their side with their knee bent in the rescue position to prevent choking. If you are concerned a friend might have alcohol poisoning, Oregon passed a Medical Amnesty law (ORS 471.430.10 (a)) which means Eugene Police department will not cite you for a minor in possession (MIP) if you call for help with a medical emergency. Helping a Friend The misuse and abuse of alcohol and other drugs can keep you from being a successful student. If you, or someone you know, is struggling with alcohol and/or other drugs, take a look at the resources offered by the Substance Abuse Prevention program, services at the University Counseling Center, the University Health Center, and the Collegiate Recovery Center . We are here to help you. If your friend has had too much to drink, do not leave them alone or give them any food, don't take them for a walk or give them a shower to help sober them up. An individual's blood alcohol content can continue to rise long after they go to sleep. Time is the only thing that can make a person sober. When in doubt, call for emergency help.
