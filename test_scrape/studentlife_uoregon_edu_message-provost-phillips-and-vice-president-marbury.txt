Getting vaccinated is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. According to our records, you have not yet provided your vaccination status to University Health Services . Please visit myUOHealth to upload your vaccination card or complete the vaccination exemption process. The deadline is Tuesday, September 14 for residence hall students and Monday, September 27 for all other students. It takes time to verify vaccination cards, so upload your information now to avoid delay in processing your information. All non-compliant students will be subject to a registration hold on Tuesday, September 28, and disenrollment from university classes at the end of Week 1. Residence hall students who do not submit their vaccination records by the deadline will not be allowed to move into their assigned rooms. Remember, anyone who is not fully vaccinated will be required to test weekly for COVID-19 through the UO Map program . This means if you have an exception to the vaccination requirement, are still in the process of becoming fully vaccinated, or your vaccination information has not yet been verified by UO Health Services, you must take a weekly test. Providing false information is against the law and students will be subject to actions per the UO Code of Conduct. If you have questions about this process, you can text 541-236-9881 or email immunization@uoregon.edu . Please do not share private health information via text. These requirements are vital for public health and our campus community’s welfare, so please complete this as soon as possible. We look forward to welcoming you to the University of Oregon campus soon, and we do not want you to face any barriers to your success. Again, please take action now by visiting myUOHealth .
