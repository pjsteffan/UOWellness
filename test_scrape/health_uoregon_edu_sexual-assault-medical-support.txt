Take the First Step to Get Help: Anytime: Call UO’s Care and Advocacy Program at 541-346-SAFE. You’ll be connected with somebody who will listen to you and help guide you as you figure out what you want to do next. During business hours (Monday–Friday, 9:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m.): Come to UHS or call us at 541-346-2770. Request to speak to a triage nurse about a sexual assault. We will take it from there. After hours: For medical advice, call 541-346-2770 to speak with a triage nurse. For mental health crisis support, call 541-346-3227 to speak with a mental health professional. If you need immediate medical care after hours , go to an emergency room and specifically request a SANE (sexual assault nurse examiner) exam. If you need support with this, call UO’s Care and Advocacy Program at 541-346-SAFE. If you prefer off-campus support outside our UO community, call Sexual Assault Support Services at 1-844-404-7700. UHS Sexual Assault Examiners University Health Services has four sexual assault examiners on the medical staff who have completed specialized education and clinical preparation in the medical care of people who have experienced a sexual assault or a drug-facilitated sexual assault attempt. There is no charge for this appointment, and it is completely confidential for anyone 18 years or older. If you are under 18, the way we can help looks a bit different. We will discuss this with you; always know you can call for help. What You Can Expect at Your Appointment A chance to tell your story in whatever way you are ready to share A chance to be heard and believed A confidential space If needed and with your consent Information and prescription for emergency contraception Antibiotics to prevent potential infection A same-day visit with a mental health professional for support A physical exam for evidence collection Collection of your urine to check for substances commonly used in drug-facilitated sexual assault A safe place to shower and free clothing to replace anything submitted for evidence Connection to resources including referrals to University of Oregon Care and Advocacy Program and Counseling Services No charges or bills to your insurance Reporting a Sexual Assault to Law Enforcement You don’t have to know before your visit if you want to report the assault to law enforcement. We can help you think this through. We do have the ability to collect evidence upon the student’s request, but we are not required to report an assault to law enforcement for anyone 18 years or older. Many people who are uncertain decide to have evidence collected and stored confidentially so they can decide later if they want to file a police report. If your sexual assault occurred recently, we recommend the following in case you do decide to have evidence collected: Do not urinate if possible. If there is concern about a drug-facilitated sexual assault, the first available urine will be collected at the clinic or emergency room. Do not eat or drink. Do not shower, bathe, or brush your teeth. Do not smoke. Bring clothes worn at the time of assault and immediately after assault, especially undergarments. If you aren’t wearing them, bring them in a paper bag. Bring a change of clothing. Bring a support person. Reach out and let us help you. We care.
