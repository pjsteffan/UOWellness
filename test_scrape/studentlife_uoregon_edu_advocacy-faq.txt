But what does that mean? Whether you need help with a petition process, need support with a conduct case, or have questions about a UO policy, we can help. We are here to be the campus experts on UO processes and procedures, so that you don’t have to be. Our goal is equal access. We seek to ensure all students at the UO have full access to their rights and resources—regardless of their existing knowledge of campus. What can the Student Advocacy Program help with? Our Student Advocacy Program team is trained to handle a variety of issues across multiple campus departments, such as Student Conduct and Community Standards, Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships, University Housing and Residence Life, and the Office of the Registrar, and with petitions and appeals from all over campus. We can help students write complete paperwork and forms, explain university processes, and guide students through the possible next steps to manage their concern. If you’re not sure if we can help, call us! We can likely get you headed in the right direction and identify some preliminary steps. Who can get help from the Student Advocacy Program? Our program is available to any currently enrolled student at the University of Oregon, and to recognized student groups. We are not currently able to support faculty, staff, or community members. Will my information be kept private? Our advocate teammates have signed a confidentiality agreement. This agreement requires that all teammates recognize and respect the sensitive and private nature of their work with clients such as you. Your confidential information is not shared outside the office without your consent, and our advocate teammates will only discuss your case with other members of the Student Advocacy Program when seeking advice from fellow advocates who have handled similar cases. Education records, which include any personally identifiable information that a student shares with the Student Advocacy Program team, are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA requires that we keep your identifiable student information private unless you provide a signed written release, or a court orders the release of information via a subpoena. Peer advocates are classified as Assisting Employees for all forms of prohibited discrimination. This means the peer advocates are only required to report child abuse and threats of imminent harm, and are not required to report things like sexual harassment, assault, or prohibited discrimination. If a student discloses that they have experienced these things, peer advocates will ensure that the student has information about support resources available on campus so that the disclosing student is empowered to make their own choices regarding their disclosure.
