The Bike Program is a comprehensive resource for students, faculty and staff that provides a free do-it-yourself maintenance workspace, classes, rentals, rides, and campus biking information. Our mission is to connect students to bikes. Biking at the UO Biking is the most convenient way to get around on campus. In fact, we think it’s even easier than driving! The University of Oregon is nationally recognized as bicycle friendly and has a gold rating from the League of American Bicyclists. Our campus is designed with bike-friendly paths, lights, and fix-it stations to ensure your comfort and safety. Biking Around Campus Do-It-Yourself Workspace The Bike Program offers a do-it-yourself maintenance workspace for all UO students, faculty and staff who want to work on their bikes. The DIY space has work stands, tools, and “how-to” books that students can use for free. Student staff are always on-site to help you navigate the space. Come visit us and keep your bike in good condition all year. Repair Your Bike Bike Rentals Rent a bike for a day or longer. Want to explore Eugene or bike the river path?
