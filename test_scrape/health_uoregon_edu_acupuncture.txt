Billing Insurance Well-Being About Secondary Menu Acupuncture Massage Acupuncture Acupuncture services include traditional acupuncture, acupressure, cupping, Tuina, and Gua Sha. Not all of these treatment techniques involve needles. Acupuncture can be a complementary treatment to other physical modalities (physical therapy, athletic training, massage, etc.) in which case, your team will work together to ensure a comprehensive approach. It is also an effective stand-alone treatment for addressing a range of issues including general muscle and tendon injuries, stress, anxiety, women’s health issues, and addiction. One-on-one, private sessions take place in a relaxing treatment space. These sessions are tailored to each patient's individual needs. To make an appointment call 541-346-4401 or stop by the clinic. Faculty/Staff Services Faculty and staff members may now access acupuncture services through the department. We are not available for the treatment of Worker’s Compensation injuries at this time.
