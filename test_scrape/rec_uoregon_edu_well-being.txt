Well-being coaches partner with students in a client-coach relationship to work toward each student’s goals. Well-Being Coaching Is Not… Counseling, therapy, or giving medical, nutrition, or exercise prescriptions and diagnoses. Well-being coaches are trained to identify when needs of students fall outside their scope of practice and work with clients to connect them with the best campus resource, our partners in Counseling Services . Who Is It For? Coaching is for University of Oregon students who are seeking to partner with a coach to work on self-directed, lasting changes, aligned with their values, to enhance their well-being.  Coaches will work with students to identify their current strengths and goals, and together create actionable steps to achieve their well-being goal. What To Expect We meet one on one with students for three sessions, each lasting about 30–45 minutes. Session 1: Identify client’s well-being goals and make an action plan. Session 2: Follow up on progress of goals and make adjustments as needed. Session 3: Review indicators of success and plan long-term adherence of goal. Discuss further goal setting. Sessions are scheduled based on client-coach preferences. Students can choose to continue coaching at the completion of their first three sessions. Getting Started To book your first session, click on the "Book a Session" button. During the booking process you can choose to attend an in-person or virtual coaching session. Carefully review the Well-Being Coaching Policies and Procedures to learn more and to avoid incurring cancellation fees.

Bend, Oregon Year in school: Sophomore Campus involvement: PE and Rec personal trainer Hobbies: Reading, cooking, watching sunsets, stand-up paddle boarding, and spending time outside Why do you want to help students with their well-being? I chose to become a well-being coach because wellness is a priority for me, and I'm dedicated to helping others prioritize it too. Life can get incredibly stressful, and I never want anyone to feel like they're going through it alone. I believe that every student has the potential to become the best version of themselves and take charge of their lives. That's why I'm passionate about supporting them in their journey. I want to ensure that everyone has the most fulfilling college experience possible. Addy Donovan Major: Advertising Where are you from?

Often when we’re so busy, the last thing we make time for is ourselves and our well-being. I’m here to help students figure out how to optimize their time and their life in a way that feels fulfilling for them. Some of my areas of interest include ADHD, time management, and holistic and spiritual practices. Whether you have a specific goal or don’t know where to start, let’s figure it out together.

I want to help students with their well-being because college (and life) can be overwhelming, but we don’t have to go it alone! I’ve learned a lot about health and happiness through the ups, downs, and in-betweens of my college experience, and I’m excited to help support my fellow Ducks in their own life journeys.

For many people, the idea of health is created by others—parents, doctors, peers, etc. I want to help students find what health and well-being mean to them while creating realistic goals to achieve their vision. I hope to empower my clients to live a healthier lifestyle that is true to them. I have expertise in long-distance running and marathon training for those individuals looking to train for long-distance racing. Ashton Smith Major: Business administration Where are you from?

College can be chaos. I have been in the position before of having a million things I want to do or do better, but this can be hard when combined with all the other commitments that college brings. I want to help other students to improve their well-being and avoid the pitfalls I have fallen into. Neive Wellington Major: Advertising Where are you from? Palo Alto, California Year in school: Senior Hobbies: Yoga, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, hiking, anything outdoors Why do you want to help students with their well-being? I think taking care of your well-being is one of the most critical yet challenging parts of growing up.
