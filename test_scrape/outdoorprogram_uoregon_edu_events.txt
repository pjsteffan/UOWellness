We offer a variety of all-levels group outings, bike rides, classes and clinics, and service projects led by Outdoor Program student staff and trip initiators. OP Outing or Common Adventure Trip—what’s the difference? OP Outings are group outings led by knowledgeable Outdoor Program staff who are very familiar with the activity or area. OP Outings are entry-level, led instead of consensus-based, and do not last overnight. Common Adventure Trips are adventures planned and led by students who have taken our Trip Initiator Clinic. Common Adventure Trips operate on a group-consensus, decision-making process and tend to vary in difficulty. Some are easy and require little to no experience, while others are technical and require more experience. Students are automatically members of the Outdoor Program, so take advantage of our low-cost outings and trips and try out a new activity.
