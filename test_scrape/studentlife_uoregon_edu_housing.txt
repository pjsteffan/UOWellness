Ask any alum about their memories of the UO, and you can bet a lot of their stories will include the people they met and lived with in the residence halls. Roll out of bed, grab some fresh food from one of our dining venues managed by culinary-trained chefs, and dash off to class. You can only do that when you live on campus. On-campus living is more than just good food and convenience, though. You’re living with people from all over the world who are students at the UO, just like you. Study in the lounge together, explore campus together, and make the most out of your on-campus advantage. Learn more on the University Housing website . If you only have a short break for lunch, or you want to grab a coffee and do some reading between classes, check out the food offerings in the EMU . There are some places to grab a quick bite, sit down and eat with friends, or just get a snack. Living Off Campus During your time at UO, you may choose to live in the Eugene community. If you do, make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities as a renter, and also know how to be a good neighbor in your new home. In addition to these new expectations, it’s important to remember that our Student Conduct Code extends off campus, too. Getting a place off campus is a big step. CommUniversity Assistants are students who live out in the community and help other Ducks navigate their new neighborhoods, connect with the community, and address any issues related to off-campus living.
