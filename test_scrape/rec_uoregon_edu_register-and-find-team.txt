If you are a current student, you already have an account. Click “Log in” the upper right hand corner. The username is your Duck ID (the first part of your uoregon email), and the password is the same password for your uoregon email account. Once logged in, scroll down and click the Intramural icon at the bottom of the page. You will have the option to: a) Go to IMLeagues where you can view all sport leagues and tournaments (and register once you purchase the membership). b) Purchase your Intramural membership. c) Purchase the golf-only membership to play in the fall tournament. *The intramural membership is not required to play in the golf tournament. But each participant must purchase a golf membership to register. After you purchase the Intramural membership you can actively create and join teams on IMLeagues. You can always view IMLeagues regardless if you possess a membership. League Sports—make sure to send your team captain or representative to the mandatory Captains Meeting. Special Events and Tournaments—just sign up and we’ll send you the info, no meeting! Need a Team The best way to be picked up is to purchase the intramural membership and then go to IMLeagues.com/uo and join the Free Agent list(s) for each sport you want to play. From the Free Agent list, you can contact other Free Agents to form a team as well as contact captains of existing teams and request to join their rosters. An additional step you can take would be to attend the Captains Meeting for league sports and let the captains in the meeting know which league you are looking to join. Unfortunately there is no guarantee you will get on a team, but registering as a free agent on IMLeagues and attending the Captains Meeting will increase your chances. If you purchase the intramural membership, join the free agent lists, and do not end up on a roster by the end of the term, you can email Sean Graninger, seangran@uoregon.edu , and request a transfer of your membership to a later term or a full refund. Leagues There is a mandatory pre-season Captains Meeting for every league. Teams must send a representative to the meeting on time. We will cover important policies, procedures, and registration information. Registration has changed. Now participants can purchase the Intramural membership starting the first day of the term. Once you buy the membership you have access to create or join teams on IMLeagues.com. When your roster meets the minimum number of required players, you can move your team into your desired time slot immediately. Tournaments and Special Events There are no meetings for tournaments or special events. Detailed registration information can be found on IMLeagues . Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
