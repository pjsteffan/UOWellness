Community Members: Community members must first obtain a community card from UO ID Card Services for $10, before visiting the SRC Welcome Desk to purchase their multi-visit pass. Community members must also provide a government-issued ID at the time of purchase. A waiver must be signed by all individuals purchasing a guest pass over the age of 18. Anyone under the age of 18 must have a parent or guardian present to sign the waiver. A community card is not needed to purchase a single day pass. However, a current government-issued ID and the guest pass form is required to re-enter the Rec when you exit past the turnstiles. UO Affiliates: UO affiliates may purchase multi-visit passes at the SRC Welcome Desk. Multi-visit passes are loaded onto your UO ID card. When visiting the Rec, simply scan in at the turnstiles and a visit will be automatically deducted. More About Passes: Multi-visit passes do not expire. Multi-visit passes are non-transferable and can only be used by the account holder. Day passes can only be purchased on the day of use and not in advance. Day passes allow for re-entry on the same day of purchase only with original receipt and government-issued ID. Minor day passes are only available for purchase during weekend Family Hours. Questions?
