We are a community where individuals of different physical and mental abilities can come together to share in the sport of rock climbing, break down social barriers, and challenge each other to reach new heights. As such, we emphasize physical activity, encouragement, support, and camaraderie through sustainable adaptive climbing. We host monthly climbing clinics and provide a variety of free, specialized gear and assistive practices including multiple seat and chest harnesses, mechanical advantage pulley system assistance, a prosthetic climbing foot, knee pads, assistive grip devices, and more. You are also welcome to bring your own equipment. Volunteers are the core of our program. We try to maintain a two to one ratio of volunteers to participants in order to create a safe and effective experience for climbers. Volunteers do not need any prior experience, and first-time volunteers go through specialized training. All volunteers are subject to a background check. If you are interested in volunteering or have further questions, contact Kristin Gloystein at kgloyst2@uoregon.edu . Adaptive Climbing Clinics Our monthly clinics take place at the Rec Center Rock Wall . Volunteers should arrive an hour before the start of the clinic. Pricing Adaptive climbing fees also give you access to the entire Student Recreation Center for the duration of the day.

You can also schedule a private adaptive climbing session for your group both on or off campus. We are able to bring our adaptive gear off-site with us, but these off-site events are contingent on insurance and liability variables. Contact Kristin Gloystein at kgloyst2@uoregon.edu for available dates, times, and pricing for both one-on-one and group sessions. Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
