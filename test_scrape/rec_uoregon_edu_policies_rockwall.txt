Term schedules are available in PE and Rec facilities as well as on the website to identify when such closures take place. An annual maintenance shutdown occurs every summer for two weeks between the end of summer term and the beginning of fall term. Maintenance shutdown information is available on the summer schedule and website. This shutdown allows the department to perform much needed maintenance and cleaning to better serve the university population throughout the year. Inclement Weather If the UO cancels academic classes or is closed due to inclement weather, the Student Rec Center and outdoor Rec facilities will be closed, and PE and Rec programs will be cancelled or postponed. If the UO declares a delayed opening due to inclement weather, the Student Rec Center will open at 10:00 a.m., but may open later on a case-by-case basis if weather is severe and conditions warrant a prolonged delayed opening. If the UO declares an early closure due to inclement weather, the Student Rec Center will attempt to stay open until 8:00 p.m., but may close earlier on a case-by-case basis if weather is severe. If there is a multi-day campus closure during the week within an academic term, the department will attempt to open the Student Rec Center from 10:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m. Outdoor Rec facilities will remain closed; some areas of the SRC may not be open, and programs may be cancelled or postponed. PE and Rec may announce additional SRC or recreation facility closures or delayed openings outside of the UO process (early mornings, late nights, and weekends) depending on the inclement weather event and staffing limitations. If the SRC or other Rec facilities encounter an emergency closure not associated with inclement weather, information will be posted on the website.
