Since then the OP has grown into a thriving program of trips, events, gear rentals, resources, bike loans, and self-service maintenance. UO's Outdoor Program is nationally recognized as the premier common adventure program in the country and the birthplace of modern collegiate outdoor programs. In 1991, the OP Barn Trip Facility was built to house the growing gear for OP trips, and in 2003 OP gear rentals were made available for UO students' and co-op members' private trips. Through all the changes and growth, the OP remains true to its simple roots of cooperative, consensus-based, safe, fun, educational adventures for everyone.

Meet our Team Student Jobs Values and Sustainability In the Pacific Northwest, we love nature. That’s why sustainability is so important to us. In fact, it’s so important that we plumb our toilets with an in-house rainwater catchment system, power our facilities with solar energy, encourage leave no trace ethics, and more. Environmental stewardship is one of our core values, along with adventure, active lives, community, cooperation, and student empowerment. See What We Stand For Co-op Membership We welcome everyone to join our community of adventurers and to use our resources. However, the Outdoor Program is only free to UO students. Faculty members, staff, alumni, and community members may utilize the OP Rental Barn, Bike Program, and other resources all year for a small fee. Those who are not students or co-op members may purchase a day pass for $5.00. Join us and make the most of your next excursion.
