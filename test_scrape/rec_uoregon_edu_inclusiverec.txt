Accessibility Services in the Student Recreation Center Downtown Aquatics: The Rec Center pool has a lift to assist swimmers who need to transfer from a wheelchair to the pool. We request that an individual who needs to transfer first ask a lifeguard so they can enter the pool safely. Locker Rooms: Both the men’s and women’s locker rooms have adapted changing areas and lockers available for rental for the term. An accessible private changing area is also available inside both men’s and women’s locker rooms on the midtown level. Directly outside of the locker rooms on the downtown level there is a private shower and changing area. This area is ADA-equipped but may be used by all patrons. A locker can be purchased for the term or year just outside of the private shower and changing area by visiting the Welcome Desk. Locker availability is on a first-come, first-served basis. Weight and Cardio Rooms: Both weight rooms and cardio rooms have automatic doors and wide aisles to make the areas ADA accessible. There is a variety of strength, fitness, and cardio equipment that is designed to be adaptable. To learn how to use specific equipment ask any staff member for assistance, schedule a free fitness orientation by contacting Andy Karch , or purchase personal training sessions at the Welcome Desk. Service dogs are welcome! Be aware that at peak hours, the facility can be crowded, and you and your service dog may not be as comfortable. Physical Education Classes Students with accessibility needs are welcome to participate in PE courses. The Accessible Education Center will assist students in finding an aide or interpreter if one is needed to successfully participate in our courses, and/or identifying other appropriate accommodations to meet students' accessibility needs.
