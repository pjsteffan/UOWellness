Throughout the year, a variety of affinity trips are offered to create safe spaces for students to learn and experience the outdoors. The program culminates with this winter term summit, where participants can come together to hear from keynote speakers, students, and facilitators on a variety of topics surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion in the outdoors. Free for students. Recommended donation of $100/sliding scale for UO staff and members of the community. 100 percent of all participant donations go directly back to funding more affinity trips for students. Registration is now closed. Thank you to all the participants and guests! Keynote speakers Wyn Wiley aka Pattie Gonia (he/she/they) entrepreneur, homosexual, queer environmentalist, drag queen Pattie strives to create more inclusive outdoors and inspire people to go outside, even if they’ve never been before. She truly embodies that being outdoors and fabulous are not mutually exclusive. Her goal is to build community for queer people, allies, and our planet. Pattie will be speaking on how we can build a more equitable outdoors and what we can all do to take action.
