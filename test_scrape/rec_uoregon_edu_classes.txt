You may attend the first class meeting and talk with the instructor about the possibility of enrolling. Some classes are unable to over-enroll (i.e. Group Cycling). Can I take a PE class for non-credit? Yes. The fee for a non-credit class is $105 and tuition is not assessed, however, in some cases additional fees are required to pay for the use of equipment (scuba gear), transportation (Outdoor Pursuits outings), and certification (first aid/CPR). Refer to the class schedule for the fee for a specific class. Faculty, staff, and community members are required to purchase membership or facility access to the Student Rec Center in order to participate in PE classes. When can I sign up for a non-credit PE class? Priority registration for activity classes takes place online through RecWeb the week before academic course registration. If you know what activity class you want to join and want to ensure your spot, this is your best option. All registrations must be completed through RecWeb during this period. Between priority registration closing and the first day of the new term, you may fill out the Request to Enroll form to be added to a class if space is available. Why are extra fees assessed for PE courses? PE classes are not funded by tuition and general fees. Class fees cover the cost of instruction, equipment, administrative support, and facilities maintenance. The standard fee per credit is $87 or $105 for non-credit classes, however, in some cases, additional fees are required to pay for the use of equipment (scuba gear), transportation (Outdoor Pursuits outings), and certification (first aid/CPR). Refer to the class schedule for the fee for a specific class. How many classes can I count toward my general education requirements? 12 PE credits can be applied to a bachelor’s degree. Cost of attendance is the estimated cost to attend the UO for the academic year. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides estimates for cost of attendance information that goes beyond tuition and fees, and includes: living expenses (housing and food), books/supplies/equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses.
