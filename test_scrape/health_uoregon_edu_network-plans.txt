What if I have an out-of-network health insurance plan? If your insurance is not listed above, it most likely will NOT provide in-network benefits for your care at University Health Services. Call your insurance company ahead of time to ask about your out-of-network benefits at University Health Services. If you have Kaiser, please contact your local Kaiser office to verify your out-of-area benefits and how they work in Oregon. You may have a Tier 2 benefit that works with one of our in-network plans listed above. If your insurance is billed, please allow four to six weeks after treatment for insurance to be processed. Any remaining charges after filing with your health plan will be transferred to your DuckWeb account. If you have insurance but haven't registered your plan with health services, we will not courtesy bill your insurance. It's your responsibility to submit the claim to your insurance. You may find itemized billing statements by accessing your statement history through myUOHealth . Remember to bring your health insurance card or mobile app with you to your appointments wherever and whenever you access care, including the pharmacy.
