Once class is over and studying is done, there are Days of Service opportunities at the Holden Center for Leadership and Community Engagement , rock walls to climb at the Student Recreation Center , and meetings to attend in the residence halls. The opportunities are endless; all you have to do is show up. Active, involved students are everywhere you look. The person you sit next to in chemistry: they might be president of a sorority or fraternity . Your conversation partner in French class: they might be captain of their intramural team. If you know what you’re interested in; do it. If you don’t know what you want to do yet, ask! Talk to a classmate, your RA, make an appointment at the University Career Center , or drop into the ASUO . (It’s located at EMU, in case you need directions.)
