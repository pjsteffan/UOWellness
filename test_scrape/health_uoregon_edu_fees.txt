You may cancel an appointment via myUOHealth up to 24 hours prior to your visit.

Student Health Benefits Plan Late Payment Fee: $100 Students who fail to pay their UO health insurance premiums by the published compliance deadlines will be charged a $100 late fee, and an academic hold will be placed on their account. Do you need a little more time to pay? You may qualify for a payment plan, which if honored will result in a reversal of the late fee. Payment must be made in full by the end of the current coverage period (term). The hold will be removed if/when a payment plan is set up.
