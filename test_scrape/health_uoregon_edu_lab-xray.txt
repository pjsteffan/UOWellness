Closed for lunch 12:30–1:15 p.m. The University Health Services laboratory is licensed by the State of Oregon and is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. Our laboratory is staffed with registered medical technologists and phlebotomists who offer a full range of services including blood counts and cultures. Your provider may order tests that will be sent to a reference laboratory (a laboratory owned and operated by an organization outside the university). If you have concerns about the cost of those tests you should inquire about coverage with your insurance carrier. Laboratory tests must be ordered by a University Health Services physician or a nurse practitioner.
