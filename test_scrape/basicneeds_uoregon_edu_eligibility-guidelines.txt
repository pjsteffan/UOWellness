About the Childcare Subsidy The UO Childcare Subsidy Program helps UO student parents achieve their educational objectives by subsidizing the costs associated with the care of their child or children. For the 2024–2025 program year it will reimburse 50 percent of eligible monthly expenses, up to an age-based maximum. Interested students must first apply and be admitted to the program, and then submit a claim for each month that they would like to have expenses partly reimbursed (subsidized). This program is funded by Incidental Fees. Most UO students are charged an Incidental Fee each quarter, and the ASUO Student Government Association allocates them to a variety of programs that foster campus culture and well-being. Some of the fees are distributed to the Basic Needs Program in the UO Office of the Dean of Students for the purpose of administering this program. All subsidy operational costs, reimbursement funds, and student staff members’ salaries are paid for by ASUO through the Incidental Fee. UO students may qualify for other childcare grants or discounts, some of which can cover a larger portion of childcare expenses than the UO Childcare Subsidy. To learn more about these programs visit the Childcare and Family page . Students are also welcome to contact UO Childcare Subsidy staff, who can help you decide which program(s) may work best for your family. UO Childcare Subsidy staff can be reached at: subsidy@uoregon.edu 541-346-0632 Office of the Dean of Students, 185 Oregon Hall Program Eligibility The Childcare Subsidy Program is open to University of Oregon students who meet all of the criteria listed below. 1. Course Enrollment and Incidental Fee Charge Enrollment in at least one credit for the current or subsequent academic quarter will be verified during the application process. When the claim is processed, staff will verify that the program participant was charged an Incidental Fee for the quarter in which childcare charges occurred (e.g. I-Fee must have been charged for the fall term if the participant submits an October reimbursement claim). If an Incidental Fee is later reversed because the participant withdrew from courses, the participant will no longer be eligible for reimbursement of childcare expenses that occurred during the term from which they withdrew. Incidental Fees are added to student billing accounts about two weeks before classes begin. To confirm eligibility, students may view their tuition statement using DuckWeb, and search for a cost titled “Incidental Mandatory Fee.” 2. Income Qualification US Citizens and Permanent Residents US citizens and permanent residents who wish to qualify for this subsidy must demonstrate income by providing documentation of participation in one of the need-based US state or federal assistance programs identified below, unless extenuating circumstances exist (extenuating circumstances are discussed in the next section). International students may also be eligible to participate in some of these state and federal programs. Any student who participates in one of these programs and applies to participate in the Subsidy must provide documentation which demonstrates participation in the assistance program as part of the Subsidy application, unless extenuating circumstances exist. Applicant is the recipient of, or has been offered, a Federal Pell Grant for the current academic year. Applicant can provide documentation outlining their eligibility or receipt of any level of Federal Pell Grant funds. Applicant is participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) . At least one of applicant’s dependents is participating in a USDA free or reduced-price meal program , such as the School Nutrition Programs (SNP) “free or reduced lunch” program in the state where care is being provided. Applicant is participating in the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) . Applicant is participating in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program (TANF) . Applicant is participating in the Employment-Related Day Care program (ERDC) . Applicant is participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in the state where care is being provided.

Proof of need-based federal/state program participation must clearly display: The name of the benefit program; Your name and/or your child’s name; and The timespan (dates) when the benefit is active International Students and Extenuating Circumstances If applicant is not eligible for federal or state assistance programs, they may qualify on the basis of income. Family income must be equal to or below the limit established in the 2024–25 Oregon Expanded Income Eligibility Chart for Free or Reduced Price Lunch . Household income is defined as applicant income from all sources, plus co-applicant income from all sources, if applicable. Applicants using this qualification method must complete a Childcare Subsidy Income Qualification Form to demonstrate income in addition to submitting the Childcare Subsidy Application Form. Eligibility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in the following situations: Citizenship or residency status: The applicant is not permitted to participate in these programs due to visa restrictions or effects that participation would have on an application for residency or citizenship. Personal preference: When the applicant may qualify for one or more of the need-based state or federal assistance programs but does not wish to enroll. Financial hardship: The applicant or their partner are facing a financial hardship that does not qualify them for one of the need-based state or federal programs, or they can reasonably expect that there would be a wait of more than one month between application and admission to one of these programs. Application Process Childcare Subsidy Application Form UO students may apply for the program by submitting a Childcare Subsidy Application Form on Engage . The Childcare Subsidy Application Form will be open for new applicants year-round from July 12, 2024, to June 30, 2025, if funding allows. Completed applications will be reviewed immediately and in the order they are received. UO students must complete an application annually regardless of prior participation. Applicants will be notified whether they meet qualifications within ten working days of application review. Applicants who do not meet program qualifications will receive information about which requirements they did not meet and instructions for how they may qualify, if possible. If an applicant is admitted to the program, they may submit reimbursement claims for charges as old as the first day of the month they applied. Invoices or receipts which cross into the prior month will be prorated. Retroactive reimbursement claims (e.g. applying in October and requesting a reimbursement for September) are not permitted. If the program’s financial capacity is reached, applicants will be placed on a waiting list in the order their applications are received. If space becomes available, the applicants at the top of the waitlist will be considered first. Each UO Childcare Subsidy program year runs from the first day of July to the last day of June in the following calendar year. For a participant to continue receiving reimbursements in the subsequent program year, they will need to re-apply and meet all program requirements applicable to that program year. Eligible Care Providers For childcare charges to be reimbursed by this program, the care provider must either: Be registered/certified in the state where the dependent is receiving care; or They must pass a background check and be approved by the UO Childcare Subsidy staff. Definition of Registered/Certified For providers located in Oregon, this program defines “registered/certified” as a: Licensed/certified childcare center-Registered family childcare home Certified family childcare home Employment-related daycare (ERDC) provider Regulated subsidy provider Recorded program (recorded agency, recorded preschool program, or recorded school age program) These categories are defined by Oregon Child Care Licensing Division . Providers with one of the above registered/certified provider designations must pass a background check and can be verified in the state of Oregon database at findchildcareoregon.org (scroll down one-third of the home page and select “Search for Child Care”). License-exempt providers in Oregon that do not have one of the above designations do not meet the UO Childcare Subsidy definition of “registered/certified.” For providers located in a different state, UO Childcare Subsidy staff will evaluate if they are registered/certified on a case-by-case basis. The applicant may need to submit a provider background check document as detailed below. Care providers who are registered/certified in the state where care will be provided: The applicant will state on the program application that their provider is registered/certified. The UO Childcare Subsidy staff will verify that the provider is registered/certified. If subsidy staff are unable to confirm that the provider is registered/certified, they will notify the applicant. The provider can be approved if they complete the background check process outlined in the next section. Care providers who are not registered/certified in the state where care will be provided: The participant can either upload background check documentation as part of their application or submit it later using the Childcare Subsidy Change Form. The background check document must include all the following details: Name of the person who was the subject of the background check, first and last If the provider is a program with multiple employees, the background check must show the program director’s name Name of agency that conducted the background check or maintains the background check registry Date the documentation was provided, date the check was completed, date the check expires, or dates of enrollment in a background check registry If date the documentation was provided or date the check was completed: Must be within the 365 days prior to the date when the applicant submits their UO Childcare Subsidy application or Childcare Subsidy Change Form to add the provider If date the check expires or dates of enrollment in a background check registry: expiry date must be after the date when the applicant submits their UO Childcare Subsidy application or Childcare Subsidy Change Form to add the provider Indication that the care provider passed the background check or is enrolled in the background check registry, with no conditions or remaining requirements UO Childcare Subsidy staff will accept background checks conducted by any legitimate agency or through any legitimate registry. Participants commonly use Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the Oregon State Police . Background check arrangements are the responsibility of the program participant. Program applicants or their provider must front any costs associated with completing a background  check. Applicants may apply for the Care-Finding Fund to be reimbursed, subject to limitations. Program participants and their spouse/partner/co-parents will not be approved as providers for reimbursement by this subsidy. If subsidy staff cannot approve the provider based on the documentation the applicant submitted, they will notify the applicant. Only costs associated with the care of a child are reimbursable. Only costs incurred for “legitimate childcare purposes” may be reimbursed by this subsidy “Legitimate childcare purposes” are defined as childcare needed so that the student program participant can participate in a UO academic activity (such as attending class, completing assignments, or working in an internship), or so that they can work to earn income. Personalized instruction within a specific subject area (e.g. soccer instruction, music lessons) or summer camp will only be considered if the program participant sufficiently demonstrates that the child is participating for childcare purposes in addition to fun and learning. Costs associated with a private education at the kindergarten level and higher will not be reimbursed, provided that a public school alternative is available. Reimbursement Amounts 2024–2025 Reimbursement Amounts Child’s Age Maximum Monthly Reimbursement for Program Participants Up to 24 months 50% of invoice up to $541 24 to 36 months 50% of invoice up to $528 3 to 5 years 50% of invoice up to $456 Kindergarten to 3rd grade 50% of invoice up to $290 4th grade to 12 years 50% of invoice up to $192 Reimbursement maximums will be evaluated based on market rates and program budget for each new each program year. Claims Process Childcare Subsidy Reimbursement Claim Form Documentation Requirements Providers that furnish an invoice or receipt: Documentation must include the following information: Name of payer (UO Childcare Subsidy program participant or partner) Name of payee (childcare provider) Date that the documentation was provided Total amount charged or paid Providers that do not provide an invoice or receipt that meets all of the above requirements: Participants must use the Alternative Receipt Documentation Form . This form requires hand signatures from both the payer and payee. Electronic signatures are acceptable if done by hand on a device such as a tablet. Participant Responsibilities Participants may submit a claim by the twenty-fourth day of the month for their claim to be included in that month’s payments. Reimbursement claims submitted after this date will be processed the following month. Reimbursement claims are processed at the end of each month and reimbursements (also known as refunds) are generally disbursed by the first week of the following month. Claims should include one month's (31 days maximum) invoices/receipts per form. Multiple receipts or invoices for the same month must be submitted together on the same Childcare Subsidy Reimbursement Claim Form. If documentation spans two partial calendar months but shows 31 or fewer days of care (e.g. July 15–August 14), select the first month of this span in the Reimbursement Month selector. If invoices/receipts span two or more full months (e.g. July 1–31 and August 1–31), use one Monthly Reimbursement Claim per month. Reimbursement requests must be submitted within 60 days after childcare services were provided. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevented the participant from submitting receipts within this time frame, they may email subsidy@uoregon.edu for their claim to be considered. Otherwise, claims for services more than 60 days old will be denied. Claim Outcomes Claim Approved Reimbursements are sent by direct deposit if the participant has set up Direct Deposit of Student Account Refunds in DuckWeb. Otherwise, they will be sent by US mail to the mailing address listed in DuckWeb. Direct deposit typically takes two to three business days, and US mail can take anywhere from two days to several weeks depending on the mailing address. Reimbursement of a participant’s first claim can take one to three additional weeks as the UO finance department sets up the student account for payment. Action Needed If the subsidy employee who first reviews the claim needs to consult with a supervisor before approving or denying the claim, the participant will receive an automated email notification that the claim needs further review. This does not mean there is a problem with the claim, and the participant does not need to take any action. The email communicates a processing delay. Claim Denied If the documentation does not include all of the required information, the claim will be denied and the participant will receive an automated email notification. It is the participant’s responsibility to determine what was missing from the documentation, although questions can be directed to UO Childcare Subsidy staff at the contact information at the top of this document. Reimbursements are sent directly to the program participant and are not applied to any outstanding charges on their UO billing account. Claim Details When to Claim Reimbursement for a Deposit or Pre-Payment Requests for reimbursement before childcare services are rendered will not be approved. Participants who pay a deposit or other pre-payment for future childcare should include these charges in the claim for the month in which the care is provided to the child. Deposits and pre-payments made prior to when they were participating in the Subsidy program can be reimbursed in this manner. For example, a student who applied for admission to the Subsidy in September and whose child received care in September can include in their September claim an advance deposit they paid in August for this care. Subsidy Application Timing and Earliest Reimbursable Charges Aside from deposits and pre-payments as described above, charges cannot be reimbursed for care that was provided before a student applied for admission to the subsidy. The earliest services that can be reimbursed are those that were rendered on the first day of the month in which the participant applied to the subsidy. For example, if a student applied for admission to the subsidy on September 23, their eligibility period would be backdated to September 1. They can request reimbursement of childcare services rendered on September 1, but they cannot request reimbursement of childcare services rendered on August 31. If the claim included charges for services rendered for both August and September, the claim would be prorated to only include charges for care that occurred on September 1 or later. Payments to Co-Applicants This section pertains to partners who are both UO students and have applied to the program as co-applicants. When a claim is approved, the reimbursement will be allocated to the program participant who submitted the claim. When both program participants qualify for the subsidy, the primary participant on the subsidy application should submit the claim. Adding a Child or Provider Subsidy participants may add a child or provider after initial admission to the program. Participants must use the Childcare Subsidy Change Form and provide all required information before expenses related to this child or provider can be reimbursed. Subsidy staff will confirm any additions within ten working days. Notices and Next Steps The UO Childcare Subsidy Program makes every effort to ensure that reimbursements extend to program participants for the duration of the academic year, however funding is not guaranteed. Program participants are responsible for ensuring accurate representation of childcare reimbursement funds for purposes of their tax and income reporting, including financial aid reporting. The UO Childcare Subsidy Program will provide an annual reimbursement statement to program participants upon request. Domestic students: Contact the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships to let them know you have applied or will apply for this subsidy and ask if there will be any impact on your current or future financial aid. International students: The UO is required to withhold taxes from grants for international students whose countries do not have a scholarships and grants treaty with the United States. If your subsidy is subject to this withholding, it will appear as a charge on your student billing account around the same time as the full amount of the subsidy appears as a credit on your account.
