If you haven’t already, please read the Student Conduct Code . The University of Oregon is a community of scholars, and part of the Student Conduct Code is about your role as a scholar in our community. Academic integrity is essential to the educational experience at UO. Make sure you know what is expected of you as a student scholar . The core of the UO experience is learning. In addition to what takes place in the classroom, learning involves reflecting on our decisions and using that knowledge to inform our future decisions.
