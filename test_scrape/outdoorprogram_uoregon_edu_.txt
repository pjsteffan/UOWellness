Find Your Outdoors The Outdoor Program's mission is to inspire learning through student-powered outdoor adventure. We facilitate local trips as well as far-reaching expeditions, and provide a wide range of gear rentals, resources, and clinics. We are also home to the UO Bike Program—providing bike rentals, events, and maintenance classes. We are here to foster healthy and balanced outdoor lives, and as such all our initiatives reflect our core values of adventure, active lives, inclusive community, environmental stewardship, cooperation, and student empowerment. About the Outdoor Program Sign Up for Outdoor and Bike Program Emails Honoring Native Peoples and Lands The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Following treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people were dispossessed of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in western Oregon. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and continue to make important contributions in their communities, at the UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.* The UO Outdoor Program travels in various locations in Oregon, and wishes to acknowledge the traditional homelands of the Kalapuyan peoples (Eugene area); Chinook, Clackamas, Kalapuya, Kathlamet, Molalla, Multnomah, Tualatin, and other tribes and bands (Portland area); and the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw (Charleston area). We express our respect for all federally recognized Tribal Nations of Oregon. This includes the Burns Paiute Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Coquille Indian Tribe, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Klamath Tribes. We also express our respect for all other displaced Indigenous peoples who call Oregon home. *The Outdoor Program thanks the UO Native Strategies Group for the first portion of our statement. Bike Program The Bike Program connects students to bikes and biking resources through rentals, a do-it-yourself maintenance workspace, campus fix-it stations, classes, rides, events, and more. Our knowledgeable staff and students create a welcoming community where Ducks can come together to work on bikes, share experiences, and learn new skills. So leave your car at home, avoid the hassle of parking on campus, and utilize the Bike Program to get the most out of your biking experience. 541-346-6092 Bike With Us Rental Program The Outdoor Program provides low-priced gear and bike rentals to help facilitate your land, water, and snow adventures.
