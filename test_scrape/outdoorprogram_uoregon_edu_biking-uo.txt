In fact, more than two-thirds of the UO population has a bike. The Bike Program is committed to making bikes an easy, safe, and fun transportation option for Ducks. Bike Maps and Routes Biking in Eugene is easy and convenient. With more than 36 miles of shared-use paths, 187 miles of on-street bicycle lanes, 71 miles of signed bikeways, and five bicycle and pedestrian bridges spanning the Willamette River, it’s easy to use a bike to get anywhere in town. You can also load your bike onto the LTD buses for free with your student ID. Plan your routes to and from campus and all around town with these maps. Campus Bike Map Eugene-Springfield Bike Maps Bringing Your Bike to Campus Find the right bike for you Bring a bike that functions well and fits you. Most students get a used bike for riding around town. Come in and talk with us about good options for used bikes; we can look at online bikes to help you decide. The OP also sells used bikes at our large Bikes For Ducks event in the beginning of each year. We occasionally have used bikes for sale throughout the year as well. If you purchase a new bike or bring a nice bike to campus MAKE SURE TO GET A GOOD LOCK – we sell kryptonite locks and cables in the bike shop. Get outfitted Make sure to be safe, legal and visible on your bike. We sell helmets and lights at the bike shop. Bring your bike into the shop for regular maintenance, cleaning, and most repairs. We also offer bike maintenance classes, rides to learn how to navigate city streets, and a DIY workspaces. Come into the shop for help with fenders, baskets and other racks to carry your gear; all of our used equipment is free to UO students! Plan for the weather Nothing wrong with a little liquid sunshine—most students bike year-round, even in the rain. To set yourself up for wet weather riding, you will need fenders (new ones can be purchased at the Bike Shop, and used ones are free). A rain jacket, rain pants and footwear are a must, along with a waterproof bag or backpack to keep your books and gear dry. Register your bike Registration is required for all bikes parked on the University of Oregon campus. The UO bike registration process is fast, easy, mobile-friendly, and prevents theft. Students, faculty, and staff members can pick up a free registration card with a decal at the Bike Program or the Parking and Transportation office. UO 529 Bike Registration Know the laws In Oregon, a person riding a bike on a street has all of the rights and responsibilities as a driver of a motor vehicle. Just like in a car, it's your responsibility to ensure you're visible (including using front and rear lights), predictable, and following the flow of traffic. Be your own advocate—read up on the laws before you go out on the road. All of Oregon's bike laws are published on the Oregon Department of Transportation's website in the Oregon Bicyclist Manual. ODOT Bike Laws and Regulations Keep your bike secure Bike racks are located throughout campus and can get you much closer to class than parking your car. When locking your bike to a rack, always use a u-lock through the frame of the bike to the bike rack, and a cable to lock your other wheel. If you prefer locking your bike in a locker or cage, you can rent one through UO Parking and Transportation to keep your bike more secure and dry. Rent a Locker or Cage Bike Safety While biking is a great way to get around quickly and conveniently, it can be dangerous as you share road space with fast moving vehicles and other obstacles. Protect yourself by staying alert and aware of your surroundings, making sure you are visible to everyone around you, wearing a helmet, biking predictably, and following all laws. Bike in the street, not in the sidewalk. Use bike lanes when available. You are allowed to bike on the sidewalk, but give pedestrians the right of way. “Sharrows” are painted on the street for bikes to claim the entire lane. These show where bikes are encouraged to use the entire lane to avoid hitting car doors. Use the entire lane if needed. In Oregon, bikes can use the full lane. Bike predictably. Bike in a straight line and don't weave between cars. Wear a helmet. Reduce the risk of serious injury in an accident. Stop and look. Stop at stop signs and stop lights. Signal your turns. Use hand signals when turning. Follow the flow. Bike in the direction of traffic. Check your route. Come in to the bike shop to get the Eugene Bike Map to find the best paths or streets to ride on.
