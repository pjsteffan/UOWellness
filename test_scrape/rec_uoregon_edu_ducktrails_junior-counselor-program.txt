Junior counselors will learn about youth behavior management and safety techniques as they develop responsible and proactive supervision skills. Throughout the program, they will learn and incorporate leadership skills, participate in team building activities, and improve communication skills while engaging in a fun, high-energy work experience with like-minded people. Who can attend? Open to all teenagers who will be entering ninth through twelfth grade in the fall. Previous experience volunteering with youth is not required. When is the camp and how long does it last? Junior Counselors are required to attend one week of training, which includes CPR and first aid certification. These week-long trainings are 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Monday–Friday. After training, junior counselors will volunteer for one week alongside a full-time counselor in one of our various camp groups. Junior counselors are welcome to volunteer for additional weeks subsequently for mornings (8:45 a.m.–12:15 p.m.) or full days (8:45 a.m.–4:15 p.m.). What activities will take place? Activities will differ depending on junior counselors' choice of Duck Trails camp.
