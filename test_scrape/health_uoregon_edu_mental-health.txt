This approach allows students to have coordinated and comprehensive mental health care from our team of counselors, case managers, and psychiatrists. Our mental health providers understand the variety of challenges students face and we are experts in providing mental health care for university students. We offer an open, safe, and confidential environment to help students through issues that may interfere with their personal and academic success. Counseling Services Confidentiality Report a Concern Mental Health Access Team The Mental Health Access Team is designed to help reduce barriers for access to mental health care and provide a bridge to other UHS mental health services. The staff includes mental health professionals such as intake/crisis specialists and case managers. Appointments are not required. Students may drop in to UHS during regular hours and request to meet with a professional on this team. The last appointment of the day will be one hour before UHS closes (e.g., 4:00 p.m. when UHS closes at 5:00 p.m.). The team will meet with the student, usually shortly after arrival and completion of intake forms, and provide urgent mental health screening, crisis intervention, in-the-moment support, assistance with referrals for medication management, and assistance to students in planning for their continued mental health care. AFTER-HOURS SUPPORT AND CRISIS LINE 541-346-3227 Any time Counseling Services is closed a mental health professional is available to provide support and connect you with resources.
