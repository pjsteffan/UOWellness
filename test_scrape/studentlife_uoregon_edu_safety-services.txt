It can also assist in recovering stolen bicycles. Registration is required for all bicycles parked on the University of Oregon campus. Bike registration cards and decals can be picked up at Transportation Services and at the Outdoor Program Bicycle Barn. Laptop Registration If you have a laptop, we recommend that you register it with the UOPD. This information will be maintained on file at the UOPD and will assist investigators in the event that your laptop is stolen. This registration information will also be entered into a stolen property database that is available to law enforcement officers throughout the United States. The information contained on this form will also assist in the return of your property if it has been reported stolen and recovered, or lost and found. If you require assistance in completing this form, please contact the department at 541-346-2919. Self Defense Workshop With so many students wanting to learn self-defense with their friends, we found a way to make that possible—for free! We offer self-defense workshops for your group or organization and are making them free of charge for a limited time. Our empowerment-based workshops, lead by Physical Education faculty, are designed to equip you with a spectrum of skills to help establish and enforce your boundaries. Sign up for a group workshop! R.A.D. Program: Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) is a program offered by the UOPD and the Substance Abuse Prevention academic program. It is designed to provide students with information and effective, proven self-defense tactics that may prevent or repel physical attacks against women. R.A.D. seeks to educate and instill confidence via three teaching methods: risk reduction principles, physical defensive techniques, and dynamic simulation. R.A.D.'s objective is to develop and enhance self defense options for women. Active Shooter Run. When an active shooter is in your vicinity: If there is an escape path, attempt to evacuate. Evacuate whether others agree to or not. Leave your belongings behind. Call 9-1-1 when you are safe. Keep your hands visible. Hide. If an evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide and: Hide in an area out of the violent person's view. Block entry to your hiding place and lock the doors. Turn off the lights. Turn off your cell phone's ringer and vibration settings. Fight. As a last resort, and only if your life is in danger: Attempt to incapacitate the violent person. Act with physical aggression and throw items at the violent person. Improvise weapons—backpacks, books, laptops, water bottles, etc. Call 9-1-1 when it is safe to do so. Information you should provide to law enforcement or 9-1-1 operator: Location of the violent person Number of attackers, if more than one Physical description of attacker(s) Number and type of weapons held Number of potential victims at the location When law enforcement arrives: Remain calm, and follow officers' instructions. Immediately raise hands and spread fingers, keep hands visible at all times. Avoid making quick movements toward officers. Avoid pointing, screaming, and/or yelling. Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in the direction from which officers are entering the premises. Keep in mind that law enforcement's immediate objective is to find the threat. They will not tend to the injured on their way into the building. Bomb Threat In the event of a bomb threat: Get as much information from the caller as possible. Report the threat immediately to 9-1-1, then call the UO Police Department at 541-346-2919. If possible, be sure to note: The time of the call. The caller's exact words. Noticeable characteristics of the caller. Any information about the explosive device or its location. If evacuation is necessary, assemble outdoors and stay 300 feet or more away from the building until further notice. Earthquake In the event of an earthquake: As soon as the shaking begins—drop, take cover under sturdy furniture, and hold onto it! Stay away from windows and objects that could fall. During the shaking, do not run for exits or attempt to leave the building because heavy objects may fall in your path. If outside, move away from structures, power poles, and other hazards; stay in an open area. When the shaking stops, evacuate the building using only stairs and call for medical assistance if needed. Stay alert for trapped or injured people; assist if possible but do not move injured people. Fire In the event of a fire: Activate the nearest fire alarm. Evacuate the building using the nearest, safest stairwell; do not use elevators. Call 9-1-1. Help anyone who needs assistance leaving the area of the fire. Close the doors as you leave to contain the fire. Only attempt to extinguish small, controllable fires if you are safe, have been trained, and are familiar with how to operate a fire extinguisher. Power Outage In the event of a power outage: Report the outage to Campus Operations at 541-346-2319 and the UO Police Department at 541-346-2919. Help people in dark areas move to safety. Do not attempt to use elevators. Check elevators to determine if anyone is trapped inside. If so, immediately call the UO Police Department for help or by using the call button in the elevator. Do not attempt to force the doors open and rescue them. Shut down any laboratory equipment that could be hazardous if the power suddenly returns. Keep refrigerators and freezers closed during the outage. Vaccinations Vaccinations are important for maintaining your health. The UO requires entering students to provide proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); meningitis; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap); and varicella (chickenpox). Other vaccinations are strongly encouraged, including hepatitis A and B, human papillomavirus (HPV), and influenza (annually). Meningitis disease is a rare but serious infection caused by either bacteria or a virus. It can progress rapidly, and early symptoms can resemble the flu. Symptoms include: Fever Headache Stiff neck Confusion Drowsiness Rash Since winter 2015, when there were seven diagnosed cases of Meningitis at UO, nearly 28,000 doses of the vaccination have been administered to UO students.
