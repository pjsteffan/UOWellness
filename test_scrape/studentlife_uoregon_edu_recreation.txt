The Division of Student Life has options and activities all over campus—and beyond! Student Recreation Center (SRC) Located near the residence halls in the middle of campus, the Student Recreation Center provides a convenient place for you to come run a few laps after class, strengthen your core in a Group X fitness class , climb the rock wall, or even learn to play tennis. If none of those activities interest you, check out all the other things the Rec Center has to offer on the Department of Physical Education and Recreation website . Intramural and Club Sports If you’re the kind of person who prefers their recreation a little more organized, check out Club Sports or Intramural Sports. Club Sports is an EMU program where you can play sports ranging from disc golf to water polo. Some of these teams require tryouts, and many involve travel to competitions against other schools. Intramural Sports is run through the Department of PE and Recreation.  Sign up for a sport with a team of friends and play against other UO students to win a coveted “Intramural Champions” T-shirt. Outdoor Programs Visiting the Outdoor Program should be on every Duck’s to-do list, especially if you’re the outdoor adventure type. Go on a pre-planned trip or get help planning your own. You can even rent the gear! The Outdoor Program is also home to the UO Bike Program , where you can borrow bikes and learn basic bike maintenance.
