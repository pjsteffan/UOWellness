The bill requires Oregon’s public universities and community colleges to hire and train a benefits navigator and participate in a consortium of higher education institutions to share best practices. The director of basic needs and off-campus support leads the UO program and acts as a liaison between the university and the state as part of the Oregon Basic Needs Coalition. The UO Basic Needs Program is financially supported by the Office of the Dean of Students, the Associated Students of the University of Oregon, and the state.
