That means we are all about, well, you. Your life as a student; the things you need and the things you want to do—we’re here to help. We deliver health care—physical, mental, dental. We deliver sports and activities and career advice. We deliver leadership training and late night activities. We deliver community, involvement, and support. We deliver a place to rest your (sometimes weary) head and enjoy a meal. We want you to have an excellent student experience—in fact, we expect it. We demand it. And, we'll deliver it. If you need help, just ask and we’ll help you figure it out. Partnering with Parents and Families We haven't forgotten about parents and families. We want you to stay involved and support your Duck(s) and we want to partner with you to make that happen. If there are ways our team can assist you, we are only a phone call or email away. Our Parent and Family Programs office is your homebase and our team is excited to support you. In addition to our exceptional faculty and academic program teams, there are more than 700 committed staff members in the Division of Student Life working hard every day to make sure your student has an exceptional experience.
