They come in many styles and sizes: grab one of our sizing kits and experiment! Remember to use a new condom every time you have sex that involves oral, vaginal, or anal sex with a penis or penetrative sex toy. You can even make dams from external condoms to use during mouth-to-vulva or mouth-to-anus sex. All the condoms we offer are spermicide-free.

They also give protection control to the receiving partner, and can be used in the vagina or the anus. Remember to use a new condom every time you have sex that involves oral, vaginal, or anal sex with a penis or penetrative sex toy. Currently, internal condoms only come in one brand: the FC2 ® Female Condom. Despite the name, they can be used by anyone! They’re latex free and coated in a soft silicone, spermicide-free lubricant. Guides Step-by-step instructions: FC2 for vaginal sex Instrucciones paso a paso: Cómo Usar FC2 How to Use the FC2 Condom for Anal Sex Lubricants Using lube during sex of any kind enhances pleasure and the comfort of all barrier methods of contraception. Lube also reduces the risk that a condom will break or tear during penetrative or oral sex. Water-based lubricant: Water-based lube is safe to use with latex, nitrile, polyisoprene, and polyurethane products. All the brands we stock are free of spermicides, parabens, and oils. ONE ® Oasis Premium Personal Lubricant Good Clean Love ® Almost Naked (95 percent organic, glycerin-free, 100 percent vegan) Silicone-based lubricant: Like water-based lube, silicone lube is safe to use with latex, nitrile, polyisoprene, and polyurethane products, but it’s not compatible with silicone sex toys. Silicone lube is recommended for anal sex. ONE ® MOVE silicone lubricant Guides Lube 101 (Laci Green) How to Choose the Best Anal Lube (b-Vibe) Oral Dams Oral dams (also called dental dams) are sheets of thin material (usually latex) used during mouth-to-vulva or mouth-to-anus sex. They prevent STI and HIV transmission when correctly used every time. Adding lube to the side covering the genitals can add extra sensation. Available Brands TRUST ® Flavored Dental Dams Flavors: Banana, Grape, Mint, Strawberry, Vanilla Harmony ® Polyisoprene (Non-Latex) Oral Dams Guides Health Library: Dental Dam (Cleveland Clinic) Love Gloves and Finger Cots Disposable nitrile gloves can be used to reduce the risk of spreading STIs and other infections like UTIs during manual sex (touching the penis, vulva, vagina, or anus) by covering fingernails and rough skin. Finger cots are worn during manual sex, but cover one finger instead of the whole hand. We currently only stock latex finger cots. Available Sizes Small, medium, large, and extra-large nitrile gloves Love Gloves come packaged in bags of five Finger cots come packaged in bags of ten Guides Gloves (frank.org) Surgical Gloves and Finger Cots (Planned Parenthood) Looking for Something Else?
