How is learning Python or Lisp or C like learning Italian or Tagalog or Twi, and how is it different? What can human languages and language learning teach us about designing and learning programming languages? Let’s explore these questions together, as learners of a second (or third, or fourth) natural language and learners of computer programming languages. This FIG is unavailable for Advanced Registration. Due to Math prerequisites for CS 210, math placement testing must be completed prior to students being eligible to enroll. CS 210 Computer Science I - CoreEd or major satisfying course CIS 210 is the first course in the Computer and Information Science major sequence. The primary objective of this course is to introduce the basic concepts and practices of computer science. The core ideas of computer programming will be explored using the Python programming language. We will cover fundamental approaches to problem solving and the creation of software solutions as well as introduce the notions of data abstraction and object-oriented programming. Previous programming experience or a computer science course such as CIS 122 Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving or CIS 105 Explorations in Computing is expected. Prereq: MATH 112. LING 101 Introduction to Language - CoreEd or major satisfying course This course is a non-technical introduction to the study of language. The course provides a very brief overview of the structure of language, sound systems, structure of words, and syntax, at an elementary level. LING 101 concentrates on the interactions between language and other aspects of biology, culture, and human life. Typical topics include similarities and differences between human language and animal communication, language acquisition, language and dialect, social values and attitudes toward language and dialect choice (e.g. ordinary language and school grammar, "Black English", etc.), political issues around language (standard vs. minority languages, questions of "official" or other legally recognized status for particular languages, etc.), language families and language relationship, how languages influence one another through borrowing and other influences, and writing systems of the world.
