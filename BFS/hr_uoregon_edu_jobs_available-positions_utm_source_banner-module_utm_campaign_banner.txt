Working @ UO Applicant Support The UO posts job opportunities online using the MyTrack system. Applications are accepted only through the MyTrack application process. UO no longer accepts paper applications. What you need to know: If you have never applied for a job in our online system, you will need to create an applicant profile. You are prompted to create an applicant profile when you choose to apply for a position. If you have previously applied in MyTrack, you can return to your applicant profile by signing in with the email address and password used to set up your account. Once your profile is set up, you will use the same email address and password to log in to the applicant portal and apply for positions, manage applications, and view the status of your applications. FAQ for Applicants Background Screening Process In addition to reviewing employment references, the university conducts job-related background checks prior to hire in order to ensure a safe and secure work environment in which university faculty, staff, students, resources, and assets are protected, while protecting the integrity and confidentiality of information gathered during the evaluation. Background checks are normally conducted on the finalist only following the issuance of a contingent offer of employment. Candidates with questions should contact the Talent Acquisition unit in HR at 541-346-5112 or by email at talent@uoregon.edu . Background Check Information for Candidates Veterans and UO The University of Oregon encourages qualified veterans to apply for positions. As a public employer, the Oregon Veteransâ Preference in Public Employment Law requires UO to give preference for eligible veterans. To be eligible for preference under the Law, veterans have to identify as covered veterans and submit supporting documentation as outlined in the implementing regulations. When applying for positions, it is important for all applicants to clearly demonstrate that they meet the minimum and special qualifications. It is important for veterans to highlight transferable skills from their military or other experience that might enhance their candidacy. The opportunity to self-identify as a veteran occurs during the online application process.Â  When an application is submitted for an open position, the candidate is given an opportunity to identify as a veteran and submit supporting documentation.
