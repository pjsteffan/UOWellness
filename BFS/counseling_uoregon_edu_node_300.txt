Our social contexts and multiple identities have profound effects on how we feel and are treated by the people and systems in our lives. I believe it is essential to frame problems and potential solutions within each person's unique experience of power, privilege, and oppression. If we work together, my primary aim will be to understand you, your experiences, and your goals as best as possible in order to collaboratively create and implement a treatment plan for whatever brings you to therapy. I use evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy to help people hold their present thoughts and behaviors up to light, examining them with the goal of increasing self-acceptance, building upon strengths, and introducing new behaviors or ways of thinking about things when current approaches are no longer working. I encourage feedback and questions throughout our work together and am excited to change approaches if it feels like we are not making progress on your goals. I am passionate about suicide prevention and my work here at the UO is focused on helping clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviors build a life worth living.
