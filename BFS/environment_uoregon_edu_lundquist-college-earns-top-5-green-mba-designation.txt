Readiness Faculty and Research About Lundquist College Earns Top 5 Green MBA Designation December 5, 2019 The Princeton Review’s Best Business Schools 2020 rank the UO Lundquist College of Business and its Oregon MBA #4 in the category of best Green MBA. The Princeton Review bases its rankings on surveys of more than 20,700 on-campus MBA students and 6,000 online MBA students. According to The Princeton Review, the Green MBA category asks students to rate how well their MBA program is preparing them to address environmental, sustainability, and social responsibility issues in their careers. Other 2020 ranking categories include Best Administered, Best Professors, Greatest Resources for Minority Students, Greatest Resources for Women, and several “best for” categories including finance, human resources, and operations. This ranking shines additional light on our students and alumni as they build major successes in the sustainable business space. In September, the Center for Sustainable Business Practices at the Lundquist College of Business brought together an engaged audience of Ducks, alumni, and community members to learn from Kate Raworth , a self-proclaimed renegade economist. This fall students were also immersed in innovation as part of Sustainable Invention Immersion Week , an entrepreneurial boot camp in which students develop a sustainable product business model. Topics included materials selection, upstream impact, and minimizing excess in the manufacturing process. In addition, a new sustainable business startup from recent Oregon MBA alumna Emily Darchuk , MBA ’18, was featured prominently in Fast Company magazine through a profile and video series. “As we invest in our MBA programs, this industry feedback is telling us that the Oregon MBA is on the right track—we are meeting a need for sustainability education on a national scale,” said Edward Maletis Dean Sarah E. Nutter . “Our faculty, students, and alumni continue to be thought leaders in the sustainability space, and this latest ranking is really a recognition and validation of all the great work they do every day to help businesses do good while doing well.” —AnneMarie Knepper-Sjoblom ’05 LUNDQUIST COLLEGE Lillis Complex In Portland Faculty/Staff Directory Computer Labs/Tech Support Event Calendar News Give ADMISSIONS Undergraduate Program Oregon MBA MS Sports Product Management MS Finance Master of Accounting Oregon Executive MBA PhD GET STARTED UO Webmail DuckWeb Canvas Handshake Intranet Request a Room/Space Subscribe University of Oregon Lundquist College of Business 1208 University of Oregon Eugene , OR 97403 Building: Lillis Business Complex 38 NW Davis St., Suite 200 Portland , OR 97209 Location: 109 NW Naito Pkwy Contact Us Report a Concern Nondiscrimination and Title IX Accessibility Privacy Policy Careers About Find People © University of Oregon .
