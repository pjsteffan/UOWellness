It aims to reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative. It is an interactive project with contributions by the newspaper's writers, including essays on the history of different aspects of contemporary American life which the authors believe have "roots in slavery and its aftermath. '1619' is an audio series hosted by Hannah-Jones on how slavery has transformed America, connecting past and present through the oldest form of storytelling.
