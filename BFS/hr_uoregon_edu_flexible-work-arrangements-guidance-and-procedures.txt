To ensure a thorough understanding of this guidance, it is critical that both the policy and procedures are reviewed in their entirety. View Flexible Work Policy The University of Oregon supports faculty, staff, and student employees (including Graduate Employees) in their pursuit of a balanced lifestyle. The university offers programs, policies, referrals and education that support employees at work, school, and home. University leaders, managers, and supervisors are expected to provide support and flexibility to their employees, while at the same time, ensuring that the unit is able to meet operational needs. As UO is a residential university, the in-person student experience requires a predominantly in-person workforce. While many positions require the employee to work primarily at a UO location, UO supports the use of FWAs in situations where there is a mutual benefit to the employee and university. Supervisors are encouraged to be supportive and flexible when assessing requests for a FWA. Flexible work arrangementsÂ can be beneficial to both employees and to the university by: Contributing to recruitment and retention efforts, including increasing the ability to recruit and retain a more diverse workforce Reducing stress and increasing morale Assisting employees in work-life balance Decreasing university costs related to workspaces Frequently Asked Questions Types of Flexible Work Arrangement The Flexible Work Arrangements Policy outlines specific types of flexible work arrangements, which are detailed below : Flex Schedule/Flex Time Compressed Work Week Telecommuting/Remote Work (special considerations should be reviewed) Reduced Work Week (Part-time)/ Reduced Work Year Job Sharing Remote Work Arrangements: While the UO is a predominantly in-person workforce, the university supports the use of remote work where there is a mutual benefit for the employee and for the university. Refer to the Remote Work Guidance when considering a remote work arrangement. View Guidance Flexible Work Arrangement Process Careful consideration should be given to a flexible work arrangement to set the employee and the unit or department up for success. Follow this 3-step process to evaluate, approve, andÂ implement a flexible work arrangement: Assess eligibility considerations for both the position and the incumbent. Request and approval. Implementation, monitoring, and on-going management of FWA. View Process Flexible Work Arrangements and Disability Accommodations An employee with medical concerns may request a FWA as an accommodation. If the unit would approve the request irrespective of the employeeâs disability/medical status, then the unit should follow the principles and guidance set forth in this policy. Ifâ¯the unit has concerns about the potential operational impact of the requested FWA, then they must provide the employee an opportunity to make a formal request for the FWA as an accommodation. Under such circumstances, in order to ensure compliance with our obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA Coordinator, or designee, will be responsible for reviewing the request, directing the interactive process, and, in consultation with the unit, determining whether the requested accommodation is reasonable or an undue hardship. Questions regarding these matters should be directed to the ADA Coordinator by phone at (541) 346-3159 or email at WorkplaceADA@uoregon.edu . Types of Flexible Work Arrangement The Flexible Work Arrangements Policy outlines the following FWAs: A. Flex Schedule/Flex Time A flex schedule/flex time refers to an arrangement that permits variations in starting and departure times, but does not alter the total number of hours worked in a work week. B. Compressed Work Week A compressed work week refers to a schedule wherein the total number of hours worked each week are conducted in less than five (5) full workdays. The most common compressed schedule is four 10-hour workdays per week. C. Remote Work (Telecommuting) Remote Work (Telecommuting) refers to an arrangement that allows an employee to work at home or from another off-site location for a specified number of hours per week. This could include working from a remote location all of the time, on an occasional basis, or a hybrid arrangement where the employeeâs schedule includes a blend of remote work and work at a UO location. Review Remote Work Guidance. D. Reduced Work Week (Part-time)/ Reduced Work Year A reduced work week or reduced work year is an arrangement that allows an employee to reduce their time commitment to the university on a permanent or temporary basis (e.g. reduction from 1.0 FTE to .75 FTE or a 12-month to 9-month appointment). Consultation with an Employee and Labor Relations representative is required to assist in determining feasibility, duration of time, and impact on pay, benefits, and/or taxes, as well as to determine if there are other policies that may apply to the request. E. Job Sharing Job Sharing refers to a form of regular part-time work in which two people share the responsibilities of one regular full-time position. Job responsibilities, tasks, and hours may be split evenly or unevenly between the two individuals. Consultation with an Employee and Labor Relations representative is required to assist in determining feasibility, duration of time, and impact on pay and benefits, as well as to determine if there are other policies that may apply to the request.
