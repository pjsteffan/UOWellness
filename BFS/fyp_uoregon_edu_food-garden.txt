Working together, we will explore the various traditions of garden making and how food shapes our community. This is primarily an outdoor FIG that takes place at the UO Urban Farm and includes fun garden activities such as planting, harvesting and pressing cider from apples grown on the farm. It is really a celebration of autumn in the northwest. Deep-Dive FIG: This FIG is part of the food cluster, which includes multiple field trips and hands-on events. This course has been vetted by First Year Programs to ensure first-term students can achieve success. The instructor will be available to assist students along the way. LA 260 Understanding Landscapes - CoreEd or major satisfying course This course presents a richly illustrated overview of the relationships between human cultures and their vernacular and designed landscapes. Students study a broad range of gardens, parks, memorials, and civic landscapes. These places exemplify both the distinctive characteristics of many world cultures and themes found in the creation of special multi-cultural landscapes. Gardens are studied as metaphors for the human cultural ideas they seek to express and nurture. Students learn about the structure and pattern of designed landscapes, the history of environmental policies and values that affect them, and the ways that landscape designs are understood and described. Students do class projects, such as making models or simple drawings of gardens, but need not have any prior art experience to take the class. ENVS 225 Introduction to Food Studies - CoreEd or major satisfying course An exploration of the field of "food studies" and examination of the role of food in historical and contemporary life in the US and around the world.
