Demonstrating you care builds trust and gives an employee a sense of belonging, both of which have been shown to increase job performance. The following actions and reference tools are provided from resource libraries available to UO supervisors and employees such as LinkedIn Learning and Gallup . NEW Featured Action & Tools: Connection at Work The best managers recognize that people want to build meaningful friendships and that loyalty and satisfaction are built on such relationships. What we know: Employee disconnection is one of the main drivers of voluntary turnover. Employees who experience high levels of belonging have a drop in turnover risk, an increase in job performance, a reduction in sick days, and an increase in job satisfaction. Employees who have a workplace âbest friendâ are seven times more engaged. What you can do: The best managers encourage friendships in the workplace by creating the conditions under which such friendships and relationships can thrive. Know the characteristics of a connected team: Trust -- Confidence in one anotherâs reliability and dependability. Teamwork -- Appreciation of one anotherâs talents and strengths; can tackle challenges together. Emotional Loyalty -- Loyalty to the team is passionate, expressive, and deep-seated. Routinely ask yourself: Do my employees trust one another and me? Does my team work well together? How am I building friendships at work? How do I create more opportunities to foster friendships? Create space for connection between and among team members Use the first 10 minutes at the start of a unit/department meeting for social interaction. Ask team members to share what they are working on and encourage questions. Utilize teambuilding and icebreaker activities.
