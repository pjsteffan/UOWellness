My approach to therapy is client-centered and collaborative. I strive to demonstrate empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard in each session. It is my hope that clients feel heard and supported in a space that is free from judgment. I view clients as the experts of their own lives and believe in the resilience of each person I have the privilege of working with. I use various evidence-based approaches to therapy including CBT, DBT, and interpersonal process. I am also trained in CAMS and aim to provide the highest quality of care to students experiencing suicidality. I tailor my approach to each student’s unique needs with careful consideration of contextual barriers and facilitators to reaching their goals.
