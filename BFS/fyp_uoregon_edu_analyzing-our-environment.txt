The Analyzing Our Environment FIG explores the who, what, how, and the interpretation and analysis, of environmental data. Class activities will include collecting our own environmental data! CS 122 Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving - CoreEd or major satisfying course CS 122 is an introduction to computational problem solving and programming in a modern, high level, multi-paradigm language. The class introduces foundational computing problem-solving approaches, topics, and techniques, including program design, implementation, documentation, and testing. The class takes a project-based, hands-on approach to developing computational problem solving approaches, concepts, and skills. A programming language is not only a medium for controlling a computer; it is an instrument of human reason, as well. Modern languages like Python, Javascript, and C++ have great expressive power. They can be used for traditional, imperative programming, object-oriented and functional programming, and other approaches to software development. CS 122 is a core ed science area course and counts toward the B. Sci. math/computing requirement. (It may count as one or the other but not both.) CS 122 is designed for both non-CS majors and CS/MACS majors preparing for the intro major sequence (200-level courses). CS 122 counts as prior programming experience for students intending to major or minor in Computer Science. No prior programming experience is required or expected for CS 122. CIS 122 requires a pre-requisite of MATH 101 or equivalent. ENVS 202 Introduction to Environmental Studies: Natural Science - CoreEd or major satisfying course This is an introductory course in environmental natural sciences. It is part of the core sequence in Environmental Studies and is required for the Environmental Studies and Environmental Science majors. It is an introductory course, designed for freshmen and sophomores, and satisfies University general education breadth requirements for natural sciences. The only prerequisite is Math 95 or equivalent. Course goals include to promote understanding of the value and limitations of science in understanding environmental issues; to increase familiarity with scientific concepts underlying selected environmental issues and quantitative techniques that scientists use to evaluate them; to promote an understanding of how science is used to manage natural resources to promote a sustainable economy; to enhance ability to think creatively, analytically, and without bias (i.e. to think critically); and to understand how environmental science issues pervade our lives and gain confidence to understand these issues and make decisions based on your understanding and values. Four environmental issues are examined in some depth: human population growth, loss of biodiversity, climate change, and energy use. Meet your FIG Assistant and Instructor!
