In alignment with this mission, SAIL stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, Dreamers, and their families. In light of the tragic and continued murders of Black Americans, and the shifting legal status of the DACA program, we reaffirm our commitment to serving, supporting, and celebrating our students of color and their families. We see you, we support you, and we stand with you.
