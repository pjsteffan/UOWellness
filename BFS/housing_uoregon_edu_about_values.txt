Equity and Inclusion Responsibility and Integrity Innovation and Learning Safety and security Our Desired Future: University Housing is a model of excellence by being a hub of innovation—creative and prudent in our approach toward accessible buildings, services, initiatives, and support structures for everyone. Students recognize that living on campus adds value to their UO experiences by ensuring lower debt loads at graduation and contributing to higher GPAs and their future successes. Residents receive a warm welcome and find a sense of belonging through active engagement in our programs and services, while contributing their ideas and opinions to shape future decisions. Students live alongside faculty and thrive in our award-winning residence hall facilities. Students who live off campus benefit by joining our community for meals or participating in learning opportunities in our state-of-the-art classrooms. Every community is buzzing with families from the University Housing Alumni Association who have invested their time, money, and support. These families return to celebrate renovations that prioritize technology and sustainability, as well as the opening of new living-learning spaces. Colleagues flock to our department to collaborate with our passionate and experienced staff. Recognizing that our success lies in staff development and satisfaction, we have implemented a training program that attracts professionals from both inside and outside the university who are eager to learn from us and adopt our methods.
