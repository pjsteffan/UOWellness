Many FIGs explore similar ideas, so they are grouped into larger common themes in order to help you narrow down your choice. When selecting a FIG, be sure to look for themes or classes that seem most interesting to you. Please note, specific classes in the FIGs are subject to change depending on department offerings or other factors. Ready to add a FIG?

The following list of recommended FIGs provide course selections that may fulfill several of your outside of the CHC curriculum requirements , such as the UO Disciplinary Courses, Math/Quantitative Reasoning course, or Second Language. CHC students are welcome to sign up for a FIG not included on this list and discuss their FIG selection with their advisor during the summer. FIGs are not linked to housing and will not have an impact on your residence hall selection. Students who are in the Honors College Residential Community (RC) can enroll in a FIG as well - both of these programs are compatible.
