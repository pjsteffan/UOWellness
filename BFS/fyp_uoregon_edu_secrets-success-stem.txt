In the Secrets to Success in STEM, we’ll cover all of them. You’ll develop your ability to learn (one of your greatest assets!) and put planning and time management habits to practice. We’ll cover the learning strategies that work and the reasons why. But success in STEM involves elements beyond course work, too. Fostering a supportive community and finding purpose in your academics are critical. With fun activities in and outside of the classroom, our FIG will be one big piece of your support system. This FIG is unavailable for Advanced Registration. The math and chemistry placement tests must be completed prior to students being eligible to enroll. Students will be in one of the following combos: CH 221 General Chemistry - CoreEd or major satisfying course Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that it undergoes. It is a science that is central to our understanding of the natural world and it serves as a foundation for all other scientific disciplines. The General Chemistry sequence, beginning with CH 221, is designed for science majors and pre-professional students, and provides an introduction to the experimental and theoretical foundations of chemistry. Students will gain factual knowledge about the terminology and language of chemistry as well as an understanding of the underlying reasons why chemical processes occur. They will be expected to interpret, reason and problem solve using fundamental chemical principles.Upon successful completion of this first course in the sequence, students will have an understanding of the basic scientific measurement system, chemical calculations, the components of matter, the use of formulas and equations in relation to chemical calculations, the major classes of chemical reactions, heat changes associated with chemical reactions and atomic structure. Interwoven throughout the sequence will be an emphasis on development of the problem solving skills fundamental for success in future science courses. Courses in the General Chemistry sequence are to be taken in order and students enrolled must have completed at least one year of high school chemistry or the equivalent. Portions of the sequence are somewhat math intensive and for this reason, College Algebra (MATH 111) is a pre-requisite for CH 221. CH 227 General Chemistry Lab - CoreEd or major satisfying course First term of the three-term laboratory sequence: basic laboratory skills, quantitative relationships, qualitative analysis, calorimetry. OR MATH 111 College Algebra - CoreEd or major satisfying course, 4-credits MATH 111Z begins by building familiarity with functions, including notation and the rate of change in a function. Linear functions, including lines of best fit, are discussed. Evaluation, identifying domain and range, and the basics of composition and inversion of functions follow. Quadratic and polynomial functions are introduced along with roots and extrema of quadratic functions. Exponential and logarithmic models are discussed with a focus on applications. Finally, transformations of functions are covered. The course covers content from Chapters 1 through 6 and Chapter 11 from “College Algebra and Trigonometry for the University of Oregon”, by Connally, Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al. The course text is a custom edition of “Functions Modeling Change: A Preparation for Calculus”, 4th ed, by Connally, Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al. Students using the national version should know that page numbers will not match up between the national and custom versions of the text. College algebra is a calculus preparation course and as such has a strong algebraic focus. Students should primarily take MATH 111Z to fulfill the MATH 241 or MATH 112Z prerequisites, although it does also satisfy one course of the Bachelor of Science mathematics requirement. Students solely seeking credit toward the Bachelor of Science mathematics requirement should consider MATH 105Z, 106, or 107. Prior to taking this class it is strongly recommended that students have recently taken a high school level algebra 2 course or an intermediate algebra course such as MATH 095. Students should expect to take a readiness quiz during the first week of classes to demonstrate preparedness for MATH 111Z. CH 111 Introduction to Chemical Principles - CoreEd or major satisfying course, 4-credits This course is designed to introduce students to a limited number of chemistry topics and applied mathematics themes that will enable students to progress to the CH221, 222, 223 General Chemistry course sequence. Students in this course will learn to think like a chemist and will study phenomena in terms of macroscopic, sub-microscopic and symbolic interpretations and representations. In addition to lectures, there will be group work and on-line homework assignments, all of which are designed to build your basic knowledge and scaffold that knowledge to develop the critical thinking and problem solving skills that will lead to success in this and future science courses.
