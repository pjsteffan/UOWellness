My work with clients often integrates an experiential, mindful, emotion-focused approach. I enjoy supporting clients as they move toward freedom from patterns of relationship, emotion, behavior, and thought by which they feel trapped. By facing those elements together, in an empathic relationship, I have found that we are able to grow more present with—and accepting toward—the uncertain, alienated, powerless, and wounded parts of ourselves. I enjoy helping clients discover and connect with the unconditional and innate goodness of themselves and others. I am also interested in the relationship between individual and community healing.
