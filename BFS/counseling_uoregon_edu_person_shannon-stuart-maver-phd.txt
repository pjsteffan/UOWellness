Areas that I have specialized training and experience include: working with concerns related to multicultural issues (particularly for individuals of mixed ethnic, cultural, or national identities), LGBTQIA+ related concerns, and trans and nonbinary identity; supporting persons with invisible/invalidated identities, neurodivergent individuals, student parents, first generation students, and persons in nontraditional romantic/sexual relationships; treatment of trauma, anxiety, sexual problems, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Theoretical Orientation and Therapy Approach: I am an integrative therapist that conceptualizes both pain and healing from a trauma-informed, multicultural, feminist, and systemic lens. My background prior to becoming a psychologist was as a licensed marriage & family therapist, which manifests in my current work in my emphasis on relationships, both with others and the self. In my therapeutic work with clients, I pull from orientations that are relational and developmentally based, such as psychodynamic therapy, while concurrently integrating action-oriented methods from multiple approaches (e.g., CBT, ACT, solution-focused, self-differentiation) to promote distress relief and lay the foundation for on-going stress/emotion management and healthy relationships. Supervision Approach and Model: I approach supervision in the same way I approach therapy and life in general: prioritizing relationships, trust, transparency, and support. Trainees come to supervision with a wide range of backgrounds, and it is my priority to honor their experience and expertise while supporting them in embracing areas they wish to grow and build their skills. I pull from the developmental and discrimination models of supervision to honor these values and work to meet supervisees where they are at in relationship to their skills, needs, and professional development.
