Summer Housing Stay in the residence halls during the summer and experience a relaxed, sunny campus lifestyle! You'll have easy access to libraries and other campus services and amenities. You’ll enjoy fresh, local, organic food at summer dining venues, and you’ll live as close as you can get to your classes. Plus, contrary to living off campus, there are no long-term lease constraints. You must be enrolled in at least one credit hour of summer classes at the UO to qualify for housing during the duration of the class. All new students will be able to move into their summer rooms the Sunday prior to the beginning of the term they are taking classes. All students are required to check out within 24 hours after their last class unless they are remaining for additional classes or are living on campus in the fall term. Students who will be living in Yasui Hall in the fall are welcome to rent a room in that hall during the preceding summer. Apply for Summer Housing Interested in living with us this summer? The application for summer 2024 will open in your My Housing portal in May 2024 . Submit your preferences, sign the summer housing contract, and pay the $25 nonrefundable application fee. Summer Dining PNW Public Market in Unthank Hall will feature an all-you-care-to-eat buffet with a variety of daily entrées and other options such as salad bar, sandwiches, and desserts. Explore Summer Dining Summer Meal Plans All summer residential meal plans operate on a flexible point system loaded weekly onto your UO ID card. Items have a point value that is deducted when you check out with your UO ID. Meal plans available for summer: Deluxe—80 points per week. Standard—65 points per week. Summer 2024 Housing and Dining Rates Summer housing rates are based on your move-in date. There are a limited number of spaces available for the summer, apply early to reserve your space. Actual rates may vary slightly because weekly rates are calculated based on an assumed Sunday check-in and Friday check-out (since it’s when terms begin and end). If you check in or out on different days, the extra days will be charged based on a prorated daily rate. All charges are adjusted upon check-out to reflect the number of days you live with us and any remainder of what you paid will be credited back. Rates are prorated based on length of stay requested on your application.
