Being from the East Coast, I call Oregon the “most beautiful place I never thought I would live.” I came here because I wanted to teach at a big school with diverse students and faculty with many courses in world cultures. One of the most rewarding things about my job is being able to discuss things I love with people who love them too. How did you get involved in East Asian languages and literature? I have always loved cities, and to me, Tokyo represents everything a city should be. I read Japanese literature in high school, practiced the language in college, and studied abroad in Japan. In graduate school, my professors encouraged me to learn Japanese culture in greater depth. Since then, Tokyo has become my second home. I visit every summer to observe new cultural trends, practice speaking Japanese, and gather research materials for articles and books I want to publish. What’s the best advice you have for a college student? Take advantage of every learning opportunity you can find inside and outside the classroom. Apply what you are studying to your own life—don’t just write term papers that you will throw away. Instead, choose projects that will help you develop skills you need to succeed in your future career. Ask your professors about something you don’t understand in class, and talk to them outside class. Be patient with yourself, your work, and your professors. Remember that college is a growing experience. How can students contact you? Find me in the Cloran Lounge in Hamilton West, and email me at alisaf@uoregon.edu . (Please don’t call my East Asian Languages and Literature Department office phone. It does not work.)
