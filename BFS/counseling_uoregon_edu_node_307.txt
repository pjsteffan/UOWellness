I enjoy working on interdisciplinary care teams and believe in building collaborative care plans with the patient at the center. Meeting each person where they are and working to consider the full picture of their experience keeps me curious and always learning about how to be a positive influence on the ways that larger systems of care influence individual patient experiences. I use a strengths-based approach and draw from a variety of theoretical approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy, solutions focused therapy, and mindfulness to come alongside those I work with.
