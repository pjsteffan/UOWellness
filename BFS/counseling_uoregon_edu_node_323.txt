I am especially interested in substance use and other health-related behaviors, identity development and exploration, relational and family of origin concerns, and perfectionism. Theoretical Orientation and Therapy Approach: I view myself as a collaborator or co-creator in the process of therapy and strive to create a real connection with clients through which I can support them in exploring and expanding upon their existing strengths and self-knowledge. By integrating narrative and acceptance-based approaches, I aim to help clients look closely at the various stories they carry about themselves and their lives and, where necessary, infuse those stories with greater flexibility, compassion, context, and empowerment. Because our lives are inherently political and shaped by systems of power, this process necessarily involves attention to systemic and sociocultural forces as they appear in my clients’ lives and stories, as well as in the process of therapy. I aspire to center transparency, humility, solidarity, and client autonomy in my work with clients, and to tailor the process to each clients’ unique needs.
