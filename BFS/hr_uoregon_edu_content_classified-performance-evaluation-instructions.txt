Article 49 of the SEIU collective bargaining agreement (PDF) and Article 36 of the Teamster agreement (PDF) outline this process for classified employees. The SEIU contract provides for two appraisal forms, one for information technology positions and one for all other classifications. If you have questions about the classified performance appraisal process, please contact Employee and Labor Relations at 541-346-2966. Remember that the performance appraisal process is part of a longer relationship with an employee that includes on-going communication and coaching. There should be no surprises in the performance appraisal. 1. BEGIN THE APPRAISAL PROCESS Schedule an appointment to discuss the performance appraisal with the employee, ensuring adequate time and appropriate space for a meaningful and confidential exchange. You may want to begin the process by sending the " Performance Appraisal Discussion Questionnaire " to the employee to help him or her prepare for the appraisal discussion. This questionnaire serves as a vehicle for discussion and creates a mechanism for the employee to contribute to the appraisal. Completion of the questionnaire is optional for the employee. This form is not a part of the official performance appraisal and is not submitted to Human Resources. In addition, include a copy of the employee's position description and ask him or her to make revisions as appropriate. The position description summarizes the duties of the position and the skills, knowledge and abilities required of the employee for satisfactory performance. It also serves as the basis of the performance appraisal. Review the employee's position description yourself and make notes of your suggested changes. To prepare for the appraisal, review supervisory files and other documents that indicate achievements and other performance factors during the year. Examples include thank-you letters and commendations or complaints from customers or colleagues. Some classified positions support a number of faculty members or administrators. In this case, it may be appropriate to solicit assessments from these individuals to include in your appraisal of the employee. Once you have gathered information and supporting documents, complete the appraisal form as described in #2 below with your initial evaluative comments. It is usually a good idea to ask your supervisor to review your appraisal plan prior to discussion with the employee. 2. COMPLETE THE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL FORM Duties Section: Use the position description to complete the duties section of the " Classified Employee Performance Appraisal " form. List each duty, its percentage of the job, and whether it is an essential function. Carefully consider the performance descriptions for each duty and mark the box that best describes the performance of the employee for that duty. As appropriate, expand on your assessment with a narrative comment that provides examples or highlights strengths and weaknesses. Narrative comments are required when a rating of "Unsatisfactory Performance" is given. Furnish comments that clarify for the employee what performance the employee must do to improve from a rating of "competent" to "highly competent"). Copy the back side of page if you are evaluating more than four job duties. Behavioral Factors Section: Carefully consider the descriptions for each behavioral factor listed and mark the box that best reflects the work behavior of the employee. While recommended for all behavioral factors, narrative comments are required when you indicate on the form that the work behavior is unacceptable. Using narrative comments, clarify for the employee what improvements are required to advance through the criteria (i.e., provide specific behavior changes the employee must make to receive a higher rating on work behavior). Employee Development Section : List the training, workshops, and courses taken during the covered period and indicate how training benefited performance. Human Resources training records may be attached. Specify future training needs (if any) and the plan for how the training will be accomplished. Keep in mind that employee development may take various forms to meet professional, technical or job-specific goals regarding duties or behavioral factors. 3. MEET WITH THE EMPLOYEE Begin the performance appraisal discussion with a review of the position description. Discuss possible revisions to the description with the employee and draft the final version. If your employee has completed the "Performance Appraisal Discussion Questionnaire," review his or her responses to the questions. Listen carefully to the employee's contributions, ask questions, and respond thoughtfully. Discuss in depth the appraisal form you completed, spending time on each duty or behavioral factor. Give examples to illustrate your ratings. Offer the employee the chance to provide input and ask questions. It is essential that the employee leave the meeting with a clear understanding of how he or she is meeting performance expectations and how to improve. 4. FINALIZE THE APPRAISAL After the performance appraisal meeting, incorporate any revisions to the performance appraisal form that came about as a result of your discussion and prepare a final copy of an updated position description. Schedule another meeting with the employee so that both of you can sign the appraisal and position description. At this time, the employee completes the "Employee Response" section and indicates whether you as supervisor discussed the appraisal with him or her. The employee may attach a written response to the appraisal. He or she may also send a response to Human Resources within 60 days which will be placed with the appraisal in their personnel file. The performance appraisal form has a space for "Reviewer" signature. Generally, this is the supervisor's supervisor or the department head. Give copies of the performance appraisal and position description to the employee and keep a set for your supervisory files. Completed and signed appraisals should be sent to Human Resources through the HR document submission process . (If there are no changes to the position description you do not need to send this document to Human Resources.) The Human Resources Director's signature is added as "Appointing Authority". The performance appraisal is placed in the employee's personnel file and the position description is filed by position number.
