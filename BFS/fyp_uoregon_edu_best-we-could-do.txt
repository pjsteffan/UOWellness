The book is a marvelous visual narrative that documents the story of the Bui family escape after the fall of South Vietnam in the 1970s, and the difficulties they faced building new lives for themselves as refugees in America. Both personal and universal, the book explores questions of community and family, home and healing, identity and heritage through themes ranging from the refugee experience to parenting and generational changes. About the Author Thi Bui is an author, illustrator, artist, and educator. Bui was born in Vietnam three months before the end of the Vietnam War and came to the United States in 1978 as part of a wave of refugees from Southeast Asia.
