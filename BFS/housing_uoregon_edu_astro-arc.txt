The Astro ARC welcomes students from all fields who are excited about science! This community is your gateway to understanding the operations of a scientific facility through hands-on experience at Pine Mountain Observatory in Oregon’s Deschutes National Forest. Throughout the year, this community will develop students’ skills in scientific literacy, communication, inquiry, and storytelling. Students will start the year with a trip to the research facility and will gain practical skills in using scientific equipment, interpreting research data, and effectively communicating scientific discoveries to diverse audiences. Why should I choose to live in this community? In the Astro ARC, students will engage in a unique academic experience not available anywhere else on campus. With year-long faculty mentorship, hands-on learning, and meaningful experiences tailored to their academic interests, this community provides a supportive environment where students connect closely with peers, faculty, and experts all dedicated to exploring the breadth of scientific inquiry. If you are excited about science, from any major, we encourage you to apply. Scientific collaboration spans across all disciplines from Business to Data Science, Art to Education, Journalism to Political Science, and many more. What are the community expectations?
