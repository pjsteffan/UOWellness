Trauma Rotation The Trauma rotation is geared towards providing the intern with a specialization in trauma intervention and prevention in a university counseling center. Therefore, the experience includes: Individual therapy—carrying at least four clients with trauma background at all times Group experience—DBT or trauma group if running Consultation and Crisis Intervention Outreach—attending the monthly meeting for the UO Alliance for Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP), and participating in Take Back the Night events Level of supervision depends on previous experience. In addition, rotation experiences could also include: integrating trauma inventories and clinical interview as part of assessment experience or work with an individual client; providing consultation regarding title IX policies; participating in rotation supervision with a trauma specialist in staff. Multicultural Student Services Rotation This rotation can be developed by the intern utilizing their own unique interests. In the past interns have developed liaison relationships with different multicultural organizations on campus, provided extra outreach on multicultural issues, had a majority of clients from different cultural identities, or had an opportunity for rotation supervision focused on multicultural issues. This rotation includes co-facilitation of a Counseling Diverse Populations course (see description under Counseling Diverse Populations Concentration). For example, some interns have developed this rotation to focus primarily on: Students from other nationalities Students who identity as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender Students who identify as disabled Students of diverse ethnic backgrounds Training and Supervision Rotation This rotation emphasizes experience that will better prepare an intern for a future position as a practicum coordinator or training director. Depending on academic course offerings, the intern would possibly co-teach CPSY 641: Beginning Counseling Skills (basic interviewing) for graduate level counseling psychology and couples and family therapy with a counseling psychology faculty member. During the winter and spring quarters, the intern could co-facilitate sections of the practicum seminar (group supervision) with the practicum coordinator and obtain rotation supervision from this staff member. This rotation might also include: Extra supervision with an additional practicum supervisee Becoming more involved with the UCC internship selection process Participate in training projects with the training director, depending on interns' interests Provide guest lectures in the practicum class through the Counseling Psychology department Concentrations University Health Center Clinical Concentration This concentration is housed in the University Health Center (located in the same building as the UCC) and the intern's clinical work in the University Health Center is supervised by the intern's primary supervisor. The intern participating in this concentration sees Health Center patients referred by psychiatrists, physicians, nurses and other health care providers because their presenting concerns include both a medical and psychological component. They may see clients with: Depression Anxiety Chronic medical problems Students who have stress-related illness Students who are hesitant to pursue psychotherapy through a counseling center Students who have received medical news that might be emotionally difficult and distressing Counseling Diverse Populations Concentration (CPSY 615—included in Multicultural Student Services Rotation) This concentration is designed to give doctoral interns an opportunity to facilitate graduate student discussion groups related to diversity issues, in conjunction with the Counseling Diverse Populations course. The Counseling Diverse Populations course is a 4-credit graduate course offered during the winter term through the Counseling Psychology Department. This rotation is supervised by a counseling psychology faculty member. The primary goal of the discussion group is to advance students’ cultural competency (i.e. knowledge and skills) with small group discussion and activities. If the class size is smaller, and the intern is more advanced in teaching and multiculturalism, there is a possibility of assisting in teaching the course. Past interns have presented on topics such as: White Privilege Ability Identity Development Racial Microaggressions Suicide Prevention Concentration The UCC is actively involved in the Oregon College and University Suicide Prevention Project (OCUSPP)—a statewide coalition of colleges and universities which collaborate to reduce suicide risk on campus. While the concentration will be somewhat tailored to the intern’s strengths and interests, they are expected to cultivate an awareness of the relevant literature and participate in suicide prevention programming on campus. During the rotation, the intern might: Develop and implement a suicide risk reduction outreach for an at-risk population Provide additional suicide prevention outreach to the university community Collaborate in training campus suicide prevention gatekeepers Attend biannual meetings of the Oregon College and University Suicide Prevention Project Choose to collaborate in conducting program evaluation research, and/or participate in consortium committee work Division of Student Life Division of Student Life University Career Center Office of the Dean of Students Erb Memorial Union Holden Center for Leadership and Community Engagement Department of Physical Education and Recreation Parent and Family Programs Student Services Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Office of the Registrar University Counseling Services University Health Services University Housing University Testing Center Counseling Services 1590 E 13th Ave Eugene , OR 97403 P: 541-346-3227 F: 541-346-2842 Report a Concern Nondiscrimination and Title IX Accessibility Privacy Policy Careers About Find People © University of Oregon .
