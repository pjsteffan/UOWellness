No matter where you are in your process, we are here to help guide you and support you. Our providers on the UHS TGD medical team are experts in gender-diverse medical needs and are committed to giving you the best possible care. We are dedicated to healthcare equity for all bodies, across the full gender-identity spectrum. Our team consists of board-certified physicians (endocrinology, internal medicine, and family medicine), nurse practitioners, and clinical staff who are trained in gender affirming hormone therapy based on WPATH’s Standard of Care guidelines as well as general medical care for TGD people. I am ready to start gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). What comes next? Call us at 541-346-2770 to set up an appointment with a medical provider to discuss GAHT. UHS offers GAHT in an informed consent model. Like with any medical treatment, you will meet with a medical provider who will provide you with correct, accurate information about GAHT, including its effects (both reversible and irreversible) on your body, its risks and benefits, and how the process will work. Your provider will answer all your questions and get to know you as a person. This process may be straightforward or may take more than one visit, depending on where you are in your journey. Once informed consent is complete, your provider can write prescriptions for GAHT and set you up for return appointments and regular lab work. If your GAHT requires injections, our clinical staff will support you in learning how to do this on your own. Some transgender and gender diverse people benefit from therapy to support their mental health as they navigate a world that marginalizes or oppresses TGD people. Counseling Services offers therapists with experience and training in supporting TGD people. You can call Counseling Services at 541-346-3227 to set up an appointment. I am on GAHT and need to continue on it. How do I do this? Call us at 541-346-2770 to set up an appointment with a medical provider to establish care. Make sure you specify that you are looking to continue GAHT so we schedule you with the right provider. We’ll want to review your prior medical records, so you’ll need to fill out a release of information (ROI) at myUOHealth so we can obtain those. I need a referral for gender affirming surgery (top surgery or bottom surgery). How do I do this? If you are already working with a UHS medical provider, they can make the referral. Surgeons and/or insurance companies may require a psychosocial assessment and WPATH letter of support along with the referral. Counseling Services has providers available to support students with addressing these requirements and obtaining letters of support as needed. I have avoided medical care, annual wellness exams, and contraception because I don’t want to be misgendered and alienated. What can I do? You are not alone. For many TGD people, a visit to a medical clinic for illness, injury, wellness exams, screening tests, and contraception can be an anxiety-inducing experience, and something long avoided. UHS is committed to gender-neutral intake forms, health histories, and patient education. Refer to our medical services anti-oppression intention statement for more information.
