Counseling Services senior clinical staff provide primary and rotation supervision to doctoral interns. We encourage potential applicants to read through supervision profiles for staff that provide primary supervision to learn more about their professional interests, therapy approaches, and supervision models. Our Team Philosophy and Goals The Counseling Services doctoral internship program in health service psychology is a one year, full-time, stipend program that incorporates: developing conceptual knowledge, applied skills and competence in individual psychotherapy, group therapy, diagnostic assessment, multiculturalism, crisis intervention, clinical supervision, consultation, outreach programming, and professional ethics and decision-making. We help you transition from a trainee to an emerging psychologist by providing experiential opportunities within a model that emphasizes support, appropriate challenge, and reflection. Our center values multiculturalism, our working relationships, and finding some fun in the midst of this hard work.
