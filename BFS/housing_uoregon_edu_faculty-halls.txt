Getting to know a faculty member on campus can help you find your major, increase your job and research opportunities, and help you later in your academic career when you need letters of recommendation for scholarships, graduate school, and job applications. Faculty fellows are instructors and professors at the University of Oregon who want to get to know you and help you get connected with the campus. The faculty fellows are fascinating people and they are great when you have questions about classes or about the Eugene area. They can help you gain confidence interacting with your other professors too. You will find faculty fellows in the dining halls, holding office hours, and putting on events. Connecting with the faculty in your residence halls is a great way to get involved and make the college experience more rewarding.
