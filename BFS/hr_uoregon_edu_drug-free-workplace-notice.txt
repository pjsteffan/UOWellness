The Office of Human Resources share this annual reminder to inform employees about related state and federal laws and university policy. As a recipient of federal funds, the University of Oregon must comply with the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug-Free Workplace Act. These laws require UO to maintain and enforce policies prohibiting the illegal use, possession, and distribution of drugs as defined by federal law. Our adherence to federal law is critical as failure to comply with federal laws and regulations could jeopardize UOâs ability to receive federal funds. Please take this opportunity to review the universityâs Drug-Free Workplace Policy , which states that the illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs and alcohol on institutionally-owned or controlled property is prohibited. Disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on any student or employee found to be in violation of this policy. While state law legalizedÂ  certain uses of marijuana for adults over 21, the universityâs policy and ability to receive federal funding is based on federal law, which prohibits all marijuana use, possession or distribution. Employees needing guidance and referrals for drug and alcohol counseling should contact Canopy, the universityâs employee assistance program (EAP) provider, for confidential assistance. Canopy can be reached directly at 1-800-433-2320, by text message at 503-850-7721, or by email at info@canopywell.com . More information about the EAP is available on the HR website . Please feel free to contact Human Resources at hrinfo@uoregon.edu or by phone at 541-346-3159 for questions or clarification on the UO Drug-Free Workplace Policy.
