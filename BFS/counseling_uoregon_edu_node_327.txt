I emphasize an intersectional lens as I work to build genuine connection and understanding with the client. I use a variety of cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal approaches to therapy, while maintaining awareness of the client’s individual experiences of systemic privilege and oppression. My work at the UO is focused on helping clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviors and collaborating with them toward a life worth living.
