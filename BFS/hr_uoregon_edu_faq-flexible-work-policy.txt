What if an employee requests a flexible work arrangement, but the requested arrangement does not meet the operational needs of the unit? Does a short-term flexible work arrangement require a written agreement? What if an employee requests to work from home on a regular basis, but only for a few days at a time? How do the supervisor and the employee evaluate whether the flexible work arrangement is working – both operationally and from a performance standpoint? Are performance expectations different for employees with a flexible work arrangement? Is there a required notice period if a flexible work arrangement needs to be terminated for either performance reasons or operational needs? Are there additional considerations for employees who will be working remotely outside of the state of Oregon? What type of flex arrangements are possible? Based on the operational needs of the unit, the following arrangements are possible: Flex Schedule/Flex Time Compressed Work Week Remote Work (Telecommuting) Reduced Work Week (Part-time)/ Reduced Work Year Job Sharing For more information on these options, please see the Flexible Work Policy or Guidance and Procedures . What if an employee requests a flexible work arrangement, but the requested arrangement does not meet the operational needs of the unit? A flexible work arrangement is approved at the discretion of the supervisor and the appropriate Vice President, the Athletic Director, the Provost, or their designee*. If the request conflicts with the operational needs of the unit, the supervisor should not approve it. The supervisor is, however, encouraged to consider whether a work arrangement exists that meets the unit operational needs and those of the employee. If an employee with a medical concern requests a flexible work arrangement as an accommodation, additional considerations apply. Review the Flexible Work Arrangements Process for additional information. Does a short-term flexible work arrangement require a written agreement? Flexible work arrangement requests of 5 days or fewer over the course of a year do not require a signed agreement, but do require approval by the direct supervisor. Flexible work arrangement requests of 6 to 30 days over the course of a year require a signed agreement approved by the direct supervisor. On-going flexible work arrangements of 31 days or longer require a signed agreement approved by the supervisor and the appropriate Vice President, the Athletic Director, the Provost, or their designee(s). Review the Flexible Work Arrangements Process for additional information. What if an employee requests to work from home on a regular basis, but only for a few days at a time? This would be considered a hybrid remote work arrangement and is allowed. If the total number of days requested over the course of a year is greater than 5, a written agreement should be in place. Review the Remote Work Arrangements Guidance for more information. How do the supervisor and the employee evaluate whether the flexible work arrangement is working – both operationally and from a performance standpoint? The supervisor must establish and follow a review process to evaluate any formal FWA to ensure that work standards are being met. It is recommended that evaluation meetings be held at least once every 3 months during the first year of the agreement. Then every six months, or at least annually during the employee's evaluation, there after. Are performance management expectations different for employees with a flexible work arrangement? Generally, performance expectations do not change as a result of flexible work arrangements. Employees with flexible work arrangements are generally subject to the same criteria and process for performance evaluation as would apply without the flexible work arrangement. HR and individual units, however, may implement practices and provide training specific to flexible work arrangements as long as such practices are consistent with university policy and procedures. Employees with flexible work arrangements remain subject to applicable university policies and procedures, collective bargaining agreement, and federal and state laws. For example, all non-exempt employees must document (via timesheet, time and attendance system, etc.) actual hours worked and leave used, take required meal and rest periods, and have overtime pre-approved by their supervisor. For more information, review the Flexible Work Arrangements Policy or Guidance and Procedures . Is there a required notice period if a flexible work arrangement needs to be terminated for either performance reasons or operational needs? Although there is no required notice period for changing or terminating a flexible work arrangement, supervisors are encouraged to provide the employee reasonable notice that allows time to adjust to new expectations. Are there additional considerations for employees who will be working remotely outside of the state of Oregon? Yes. Employment provisions and benefits may vary by state.
