The pharmacy offers the following clinical services to students, faculty members, and staff: Vaccines: From annual vaccinations for seasonal influenza, to catching up on recommended basic vaccines, the pharmacy team has collectively administered thousands of vaccinations. We can bill your medical or pharmacy insurance, often at no cost to the patient. Birth control : Our pharmacists can prescribe pills, patches and rings to meet your contraceptive needs. Please contact the pharmacy directly for available appointment times. We can usually see you within one or two business days—or sometimes even the same day! Smoking cessation/nicotine replacement therapy : If cigarettes are part of your daily routine and you’re ready to commit to a healthier future, our pharmacists can help. We’ll start assessing your smoking patterns, putting you in touch with support, and then prescribing nicotine patches/gum/lozenges and Chantix or Zyban/bupropion. Prescribed products are frequently covered by health insurance, often at low or no cost to the patient. Naloxone/Narcan: If you or someone you know is at risk for an opioid overdose, our pharmacists can prescribe Naloxone.  When administered to someone experiencing an opioid overdose, Naloxone can help buy the extra time needed for emergency help to arrive. Pharmacists are recognized as providers in Oregon and your consultation visit may be covered by your medical insurance; check with your plan administrator to confirm coverage.
