More information regarding summer assignments and payroll practices is available on the Office of the Provost website. Summer Term Schedule Most summer term courses are offered in four-or eight-week sessions. For purposes of teaching assignments, summer term is divided into sessions, see the table below: Start and end dates for all summer teaching assignments follow the session dates for 4, 8 and 11 week courses. The table below illustrates those principles for Summer Term. SUMMER TERM ASSIGNMENT DATES (four- and eight-week sessions) Contract Session Duration of Class HR/Payroll Deadline Session Start Date Session End Date Payroll Submission Start Date Payroll Submission End Date Notification Deadline 1 8 weeks May 15 June 24 August 16 June 16 August 15 May 10 1.1 4 weeks May 15 June 24 July 19 June 16 July 15 May 10 1.2 4 weeks June 15 July 22 August 16 July 16 August 15 June 10 2 4 weeks July 15 August 19 September 13 August 16 September 15 July 10 Important Notes: Summer instructional assignments for course durations other than four or eight weeks should use the dates that the course is held (note:Â on the payroll documents use a minimum of 1 week even if the course is shorter). Weekend classes need to include a day on either side of the weekend. Assignment dates for those classes will reflect the period during which effort is expended, not to exceed 100% for the period of one month (pay dates on the PAW should include prep and grading). Summer Overload The maximum teaching effort during any given session during summer term is 100%. On occasion, summer faculty may be asked to teach more than one four credit hour course in a one month period.Â  In that case, overload compensation must be approved in advance from the Provost or designee. This approval will be facilitated by including information in the remarks of the summer submission upload and attaching a PAW showing the total pay. Any summer assignments with overload will require Provost approval, and it will be sent to OtP from HR through the forms workflow. Treat current 12-month employees as follows: Research faculty should be released from duties in their 12 month position during the period of their teaching assignment. The FTE in the research appointment will be reduced accordingly using the appointment percent change form.Â  Per the guidelines issued by OtP and the VPRI, research faculty shall not exceed 1.0 during summer appointments. OAs and Classified employees, please contact University HR Operations hrops@uoregon.edu for guidance. Teaching Assignment Memo A communication (memo, email) must be sent to each faculty member from the department head with the teaching assignments for the summer term. Please use the template language found here: Assignment Memo - Salaried Assignment Memo - Hourly Summer term FTE, in most cases, should be based on what that course FTE would be during an academic year term. The faculty member would then be paid during the timeframe of the session they are teaching the class(es). Summer Term Recruitment & Assignment Documentation For Summer 2024, use the table below to determine the required documentation for assigning summer instructors. Employment status Required Documentation New hire or rehire after >1 Yr Separation New to UO â never been employed Rehires that have not worked for the UO for more than a year Current and former GEs, student employees, and temporary employees 2024 Hires: Send an email to backgroundcheck@uoregon.edu with the Applicant's Name, and Email - noting this is for a summer instructional hire. If more than one, please send as a list if possible. University HR will order the online background check and the candidate will receive email instructions for completing the background check. Please notify the applicant that they will be receiving this email request. If the hire needs a 95#, while you wait for the background check results, submit an EIF to payroll, found inÂ the payroll new hire packet . After you receive the background check clearance, have the new hire complete the remainder of the payroll new hire packet and submit it to payroll (current GEs, students, and temporary employees are not required to complete the packet.)

Department immediately notifies Payroll and Human Resources that the facultyâs summer instruction pay should be cancelled to prevent overpayment. If the employee has other teaching assignments for the summer term: The department head notifies the employee in writing that the class is cancelled. Department completes a new PAW, and uploads the revised PAW to a new Summer Upload. Email notification to Payroll and copy University HR Operations to avoid overpayment if the form is with payroll for processing or has already been reviewed.
