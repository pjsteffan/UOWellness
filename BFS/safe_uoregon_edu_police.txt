Help from Law Enforcement If you are (or someone you are with is) in immediate danger or feel unsafe, call 9‑1‑1. It is a student’s right to report any situation to law enforcement. In non-emergency situations, if the incident occurred on campus, contact the University of Oregon Police Department at 541‑346‑2919.  If the incident occurred off-campus in Eugene, call 541‑682‑5111. If the incident occurred in Springfield, call 541‑726‑2536. Students who are not sure who to contact, or who would like help in making a report should call the UO SAFE hotline at 541‑346‑7233 (SAFE). Students over the age of 18 have the right to choose whether or not they want to file a formal police report and press criminal charges. Staff from the Care and Advocacy Program in the Office of the Dean of Students can accompany any student to meet with law enforcement, if a student requests. Survivors of sexual assault can go to a local emergency room or University Health Services where they can receive a free exam from a specially trained nurse to collect evidence to preserve in case the student wishes to pursue criminal action. University of Oregon Police Department The University of Oregon Police Department provides 24-hour services to protect the safety of the University of Oregon campus community and is part of the integrated campus response to issues of sexual harassment. Information provided to UOPD will be shared with staff in the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance and the Office of the Dean of Students so that support and accommodations can be provided to the survivor, and so that necessary steps can be taken by the institution to help protect the survivor and the campus community. A survivor can make a report to law enforcement but still choose not to press criminal charges. Then, if the survivor decides to proceed, police can help with recording incident information and collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses or suspects, making arrests, or otherwise filing criminal charges. The survivor has until the expiration of the statute of limitations for any crime to decide to press charges. Survivors should also know that pursuing a criminal case does not commit a prosecuting attorney to filing a case. Law enforcement investigation material may also be used in Title IX or student conduct processes, to provide more options to survivors in addition to criminal justice possibilities. UOPD and its partners are committed to using survivor-centered, trauma-informed approaches that minimize discomfort or distress for survivors.
