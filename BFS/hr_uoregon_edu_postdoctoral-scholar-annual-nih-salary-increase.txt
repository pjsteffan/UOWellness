New and Renewing NIH Postdoc Hires NIH postdoc hires should be placed on a step at hire that coincides with their postdoc experience. Work experience that is not postdoctoral work should not be considered when determining the postdoc step. All postdoctoral scholar offers require a pay action request form be attached to the offer in MyTrack. Per the United Academics CBA, the minimum salary floor for NIH Postdoctoral Scholars on 12-month appointments will be no less than the amounts set according to the NIH Postdoctoral minimum salary schedule and the floor is adjusted each year pursuant to that NIH schedule annually effective July 1st. No retroactive pay is issued for NIH increases due to grant reporting and funding. Every year after the employee's anniversary*, the employee will be moved to the next NIH level that matches their years of employment at the UO if not hired on a step. Employees hired at a rate of pay outside of the NIH level or at a different level other than "0 Years" will not move to the next minimum until the years of experience at the UO is met and current pay falls below the NIH step. *Please note that all the time in a postdoctoral appointment at the UO is counted towards years of service towards the 3 and 5 year limits. The anniversary date is the 1st of the month coinciding with or following the start of postdoc appointment at the UO.
