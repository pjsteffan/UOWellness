How do I pay for college if my parents do not take out the Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan? Because of federal loan limits, students may not have enough federal funds to cover all tuition, room and board, books, supplies, and personal expenses. If students are looking for a source of aid to replace the offered Parent PLUS Loan, students have the option of applying for an Alternative Student Loan . If a parent is ineligible for the PLUS, they may appeal the credit decision, pursue the loan with the help of a cosigner, or the student may request additional unsubsidized loans .

If you do not have enough federal aid to cover all costs associated with attending the University of Oregon, we recommend speaking with a counselor in our office during drop-in hours . Am I eligible for financial aid? Not only must you apply for financial aid , but you must meet specific criteria to be eligible for aid . This includes eligibility requirements, rights and responsibilities, and aggregate Pell Grant and loan limits. How do I qualify for resident tuition rates?

The financial information reported on the FAFSA cannot be updated to reflect your current financial situation. For special circumstances such as the loss of a job, a large reduction in income, or extraordinary medical expenses, please do the following: To estimate how a change in your family income might impact your student aid index ( replaces "estimated family contribution" beginning with 2024-25 FAFSA ), use our Net Price Calculator to simulate a recalculation of your student aid index using more recent income information. That will allow you to see how this could potentially impact eligibility for financial aid. If the Net Price Calculator results in projecting a change in financial aid eligibility using more recent income, please contact a financial aid counselor to provide details of the changes to your financial situation as well submit documentation of income such as tax documents, W2s, pay stubs, etc. I have unsual circumstances concerning the relationship with my parents. What are my options to be considered an independent student for fianncial aid purposes? The FAFSA has published criteria for what makes a student independent. For students that do not meet the federal criteria to be an independent student, but have unusual circumstances, they may provide additional information and request a dependency override . I am a veteran. What other services are available to me? Financial aid is available for eligible students that apply . The UO also has many Veteran Services offered by multiple departments. Where is my financial aid refund? Financial aid typically pays to your UO student account prior to the start of each term. If your financial aid is greater than the amount owed on your student account, a refund is issued. To check the disbursement date for a given term, use the Academic Calendar . If this date has come and you have not received your aid, it may be due to one of these common reasons: You are set up for full-time aid, but are not registered for enough credits . You are not making satisfactory academic progress . You have not completed all requirements to be eligible for aid. Check DuckWeb . Your aid has paid, but was not larger than your bill. Check DuckWeb . If none of these reasons apply to you, contact us . What happens if I withdraw from school before the term is over?
