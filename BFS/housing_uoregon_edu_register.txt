Admitted students will soon be receiving an email inviting them to log in and register for housing. Students do not need to be committed to the UO to register for housing. Non-freshman students (which would include returning, transfer, exchange, visiting, and American English Institute students) starting at the UO this fall and looking to live on campus for 2024–25 academic year are invited to register for housing at housing.uoregon.edu/myhousing . We anticipate spaces for non-first-time full-time students will be limited. There will be an interest wait list if capacity is reached. The interest wait list will be used as spaces become available, with priority based on earliest registration date. Those who have not been offered a residence hall assignment by August 15, 2024, will be asked if they would like to remain on the list. New students will use the UO ID Login option and then register (create an account) on the My Housing portal using the 95# in the email they are sent. Click the “Register Today” button to get started! Register Today When to Register All first-year students at the UO live on campus . As soon as you are admitted to the University of Oregon, you can fill out your housing registration . The earlier you sign up for housing, the more choices you will have when selecting your room. Take a look at room types , meal plans , and academic residential communities to help fill out your registration. Stay Another Year After your first year on campus, if you want to live on campus again you can sign up on my housing to keep your current room, select from any available room, or choose a micro studio or 4-bedroom unit in our new apartment-style residence hall. Registration is open, current residents were invited by email to register. You might also consider university apartments . Studying on campus over the summer? No worries, there is summer housing available. Learn more about living here next year . Registration Details Students select their rooms (based on registration dates). The sooner you complete your housing registration the more options you will have. Complete your registration , then sign your contract and pay a $50 registration fee (returning students don’t pay a registration fee) and a $350 initial housing payment that goes toward your fall term room and board costs. Some students are eligible to defer the initial payment based on need. Students can update their registration form, search for roommates starting in June, and select their room at their designated time in July by logging onto My Housing . Deferrals Students who qualify and choose to waive their admission application fee and/or Advance Tuition fee may also choose to defer their initial University Housing payment. For those who qualify, an option to defer will be included in the online payment registration process. Deferrals have the same financial commitment as payments and must follow the same cancellation guidelines. Please contact University Housing for more information.
