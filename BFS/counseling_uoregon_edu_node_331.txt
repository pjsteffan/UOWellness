My therapeutic style is informed by humanistic, multicultural, ecological, and critical orientations. I believe that a person’s intersecting identities mediate lived experience, and that one’s environment and family dynamics inform relationship to self and others. I place high importance on social justice and advocacy and strive to empower clients toward deeper awareness and new skill. I work with folx experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, life transitions, interpersonal relationship issues, identity development, self-esteem issues, grief, and distress due to racial/cultural and gender/sexual minoritization.
