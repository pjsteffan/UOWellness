From the original glue stick to the transition to more robust binding agents, we’ve learned that much imagination and creativity can be found within these seemingly humble tools. We will also discuss how historical cultures relied upon adhesives for their survival.  In this FIG we will learn about the long history of adhesives used throughout human history and focus on explaining the chemical principles behind them. Our work will also focus on many local adhesive technologies used throughout the history of the Pacific Northwest. We will also pay attention to the many applied ways adhesives have been used. Whether it’s binding individual units together to build an arrow, or using modern adhesives (i.e., resins) to build our own creation as our final project!  This class will be a mix of lecture, field trips and of course, construction — all with the chemistry of these processes and the history of their uses guiding our way. This FIG provides interactive opportunities to explore Chemistry in real world applications. No previous Art/Construction or Chemistry experience is needed to be successful in this course. This FIG is unavailable for Advanced Registration. The math and chemistry placement tests must be completed prior to students being eligible to enroll. CH 111 Introductory Chemical Principles- CoreEd or major satisfying course This course is designed to introduce students to a limited number of chemistry topics and applied mathematics themes that will enable students to progress to the CH221, 222, 223 General Chemistry course sequence. Students in this course will learn to think like a chemist and will study phenomena in terms of macroscopic, sub-microscopic and symbolic interpretations and representations. In addition to lectures, there will be group work and on-line homework assignments, all of which are designed to build your basic knowledge and scaffold that knowledge to develop the critical thinking and problem solving skills that will lead to success in this and future science courses. MATH 111 College Algebra - CoreEd or major satisfying course MATH 111Z begins by building familiarity with functions, including notation and the rate of change in a function. Linear functions, including lines of best fit, are discussed. Evaluation, identifying domain and range, and the basics of composition and inversion of functions follow. Quadratic and polynomial functions are introduced along with roots and extrema of quadratic functions. Exponential and logarithmic models are discussed with a focus on applications. Finally, transformations of functions are covered. The course covers content from Chapters 1 through 6 and Chapter 11 from “College Algebra and Trigonometry for the University of Oregon”, by Connally, Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al. The course text is a custom edition of “Functions Modeling Change: A Preparation for Calculus”, 4th ed, by Connally, Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al. Students using the national version should know that page numbers will not match up between the national and custom versions of the text. College algebra is a calculus preparation course and as such has a strong algebraic focus. Students should primarily take MATH 111Z to fulfill the MATH 241 or MATH 112Z prerequisites, although it does also satisfy one course of the Bachelor of Science mathematics requirement. Students solely seeking credit toward the Bachelor of Science mathematics requirement should consider MATH 105Z, 106, or 107. Prior to taking this class it is strongly recommended that students have recently taken a high school level algebra 2 course or an intermediate algebra course such as MATH 095. Students should expect to take a readiness quiz during the first week of classes to demonstrate preparedness for MATH 111Z. Meet your FIG Assistant and Instructor!
