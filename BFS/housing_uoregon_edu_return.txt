As a current student living in the residence halls, you can continue to live in the heart of where you learn, connect, and eat. Live here next year and take advantage of priority room selection, flexible contracts, and more. Non-freshman students (which would include returning, transfer, exchange, visiting, and American English Institute students) starting at the UO this fall and looking to live on campus for 2024–25 academic year are invited to register for housing at housing.uoregon.edu/myhousing . Registration begins in mid-December (current residents will be notified by email). We anticipate spaces for non-first-time full-time students will be limited. There will be an interest wait list if capacity is reached. The interest wait list will be used as spaces become available, with priority based on earliest registration date. Those who have not been offered a residence hall assignment by August 15, 2024, will be asked if they would like to remain on the list.
