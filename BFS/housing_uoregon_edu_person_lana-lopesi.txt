My area of interests include Pacific studies, Indigenous and women of color feminisms, contemporary art and visual cultures, and diaspora and mobility studies. What brought you to the University of Oregon? I came to the University of Oregon from Aotearoa New Zealand to join the Department of Indigenous, Race and Ethnic Studies. I was really excited about the possibility to teach across my areas of expertise here on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, and to share my interests with our students. What’s the best advice you have for a college student? College is hard, and can be overwhelming, but before you know it, it will be over. So enjoy it, take care of yourself, and make use of all the opportunities on campus and experiences that come with college life. How can students contact you?
