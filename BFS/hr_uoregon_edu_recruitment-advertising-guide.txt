Recruitment advertising guidance varies based on the type of type of position you are hiring for. Faculty Officers of Administration Classified Recruitment Advertising Focus Group In Fall 2017, the Talent Acquisition team invited all HR Partners to attend a recruitment advertising focus group. The meeting covered the results of the Spring 2017 Recruitment Advertising Survey, shared utilization statistics, provided an update on our enterprise-wide contract with The Register-Guard, and solicited input on a strategic advertising resource guide. In February 2018, Talent Acquisition and University Communications invited all HR Partners to attend a Recruitment Advertising Update Meeting as a follow-up to the Fall 2017 focus group. The meeting covered the upcoming launch of a new internal process to post job advertisements in The Register-Guard, and showcased the new Recruitment Advertising Resource tool located on the HR website.
