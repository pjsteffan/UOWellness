This is an attempt to promote graduation and retention rates and develop the veteran community on campus. A focus will be the exploration of education systems around the University of Oregon, and their effect on veteran students. Discussions and projects are based on creating support networks and strategies to navigate these systems. Students will read and learn about other topics around education such as leveraging skills gained from service, self advocacy, understanding what graduate studies are, and the pathways through and beyond their current goals.
