With a population of over 150,000, Eugene has a number of options for pharmacy services. We like to think the best choice for students is right here on campus. Convenience We're located on campus near most of the residence halls, and in the same building as all of the health services clinicians. If you have an existing prescription, we can contact your hometown pharmacy to have it transferred to us. We can bill most insurance plans, or you can also bill your university account like other university fees. University Focus Our pharmacy team has more than 50 years of combined experience in college health pharmacy practice and understands the unique healthcare issues that face students today. We work closely with the health services medical staff to make sure that prescriptions filled here are optimized for efficacy, appropriateness, and affordability. Price Many prescription and nonprescription items are significantly cheaper than at a traditional retailer. Our not-for-profit status enables us to buy at a significant savings. You may be able to save a dollar or two after a 20–30 minute bus ride to a big box store, but most of the time we’re very close in price to even the big guys.
