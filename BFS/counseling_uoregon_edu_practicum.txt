The major goal of the practicum internship training program is to provide high-quality learning experiences to practicum interns in counseling or clinical psychology. The primary objectives of this nine-month practicum internship are to train counselors: To learn about the phases of therapy (rapport building, empathy and affective facilitation, cognitive and behavioral work, and termination) To broaden exposure to various theoretical orientations in order to improve case conceptualization skills To increase in-session risk-taking with clients, i.e. “Feel the fear and do it anyway" To increase awareness of issues related to diversity and ethics To develop skills in conceptualizing and intervening with differing client concerns To participate in facilitating the growth of peers through support and constructive feedback To learn to take responsibility for getting training needs met and developing skills related to working with a team of professionals, including seeking out those staff most appropriate for consultation about client issues The secondary learning options of this nine-month practicum internship are: To learn outreach approaches for prevention on a college campus To learn intake assessment, crisis intervention, and disposition skills To develop skill in group therapy through observation and possible co-leadership These tasks will be met by individual supervision, practicum seminar/group supervision, clinical consultation team meetings, case presentations, professional development trainings, clinical experiences, and through the trainee’s own interactions with staff and peers. Counseling Services has a strong commitment to training new professionals and welcomes student involvement in our center. This is a nine month/16-18 hour a week practicum internship which meets the requirements for doctoral level practicum students. It is designed: To train counselors in the formation of an integrated professional identity To enhance basic professional skills for establishment of therapeutic relationships To conceptualize and provide treatment for a diverse population of students at the University of Oregon Counselors have the opportunity to practice both long- and short-term individual therapy with students who have a wide range of concerns and who come from varied backgrounds (e.g., race, ethnicity, culture, etc.).
