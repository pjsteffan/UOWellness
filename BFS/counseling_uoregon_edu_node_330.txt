I utilize a person-centered, strength-based approach emphasizing the importance of self-determination. I strive to provide compassionate, authentic support often incorporating CBT, DBT, and Mindfulness strategies. In my previous professional roles, I have worked in various community mental health settings that include outpatient mental health, school-based counseling, utilization/behavioral case management, psychiatric secure residential, and intensive community-based services. I have valued my work in supporting underserved and/or marginalized populations in Oregon, such as individuals living with a serious mental illness or unhoused adults. I look forward to supporting students here at the University of Oregon to manage a sometimes-stressful time in life, develop a sense of self, and assist in the process to increase mental health and well-being overall.
