To ensure compliance with state law, supervisors should be aware of the following: UOSW has the right to give 30-minute presentations to new student employees within 30 calendar days of their first day of work. This should be paid time for student workers in attendance. This is applicable regardless of the number of students attending orientation. Departments are responsible for reporting upcoming new student employee orientations. They may do so using the link below. If departments do not hold new employee orientations, they must identify another time for UOSW to meet with new student employees. Report an upcoming student employee orientation here Frequently Asked Questions What if my department doesnât do new employee orientations for student workers? If departments do not host new employee orientations for their employees, they must identify another time that UOSW can present to their new employees within 30 days of their start date. This can be at individual or group meetings and can also be done through the above link. What is the process for scheduling UOSW to present at new student worker orientations? Supervisors should use the link above to inform UOSW of upcoming new employee orientations, letting UOSW know which portion of the new employee orientation they can present at. Does this apply to all staff trainings, or just orientations for new student workers? This only applies to orientations for new student workers. Do we need to provide anything for UOSW during their presentations? No, itâs not necessary. However, if your space is equipped with video projection or a screen, please allow them to utilize it. Is the UOSW presentation optional for student workers? The presentation is optional, however, the university shouldnât do or say anything to the student workers to try to dissuade them from attending. Do we need to provide the location? In general, yes. In most cases, it will likely make sense for the presentation to be held in the same location as the rest of the new employee orientation. However, in some circumstances it may make sense to move to a new location, such as if the orientation takes place in a supervisor's personal office. Is UOSW allowed to go over 30 minutes? The university has an obligation to provide 30 minutes so that UOSW can present to new student workers, and we are required to allow UOSW 30 minutes of uninterrupted time to present. For example, if you are running behind schedule and they need to start late, they must still be given 30 minutes to present. What happens if departments forget to report student worker orientations? UOSW should be given the opportunity to present to all new student workers. If departments forget to report a new employee orientation, supervisors should identify another time they can present to new hires. Submit the âStudent Employee Orientation Report Formâ above as soon as this time is identified. What should UO professional staff do during UOSW presentations? UO professional staff do not need to be present during UOSW presentations. If they choose to stay in the room, it is important not to interrupt or interfere. Is it guaranteed that UOSW will come and present at my orientation? No. UOSWâs attendance at a new employee orientation will be dependent upon their capacity and availability. Who will be giving the UOSW presentation? They will be given by UOSW representatives, who in most cases are UO student workers. How much notice must UOSW be given about upcoming student orientations? Supervisors should aim to give UOSW as much notice as possible. They should submit the âStudent Employee Orientation Report Formâ (above) once the orientation is scheduled. What information will UOSW be sharing during their presentation? UOSW may present on whatever information they consider relevant to their members. This may include rights and benefits, updates on bargaining efforts, or other pertinent matters concerning student workers. We donât have it in our budget to extend our student orientation. What should we do? We understand the financial constraints departments may face, however, it's essential the university complies with state law by providing the opportunity for UOSW to present. Options could include separating workplace training from new employee orientations or integrating training into on-going meetings. These and other university policies are not intended to contravene employee rights established under ORS 663.110 and Oregon law.
