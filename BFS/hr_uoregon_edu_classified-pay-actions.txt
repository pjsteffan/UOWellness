PROMOTION: A promotion for classified employee occurs when an employee is selected for a position in a higher salary range as the result of a search.  The employee receives a one-step increase upon promotion.  If a one-step increase is below the first step of the new range, the employee will be paid at the first step. RECLASSIFICATION: Reclassification is a change in the classification of a position by moving it to a different classification and is based on a finding that the duties, authority and/or responsibilities of a position have been enlarged, diminished or altered, but the knowledge, skills and abilities required are still essentially similar to those previously required. Employees may request reclassification by submitting their draft-position description and written explanation with all relevant evidence for the proposed reclassification to hrclasscomp@uoregon.edu or to HR through campus mail. Supervisors may request a reclassification by updating/editing the employee's position description and submitting written explanation with all relevant evidence in MyTrack using the Reason and Approval process for Reclassification. TRANSFER/DEMOTION: Classified employees who transfer or demote (i.e., move to a position in the same salary range or lower) receive no increase at the point of transfer or demotion but are eligible for a step increase at the regular increase date, until the top of the range is reached.  An employee who demotes may not be paid more than the top step in the new range. SPECIAL MERIT INCREASE :  Classified employees may receive special merit increases as outlined below. These increases are granted in addition to the annual merit step increase, described above.  A special merit increase does not affect the regular annual increase:  it is an additional step increase granted either at the time of the regular increase (i.e., a two-step hike) or at different time of the year.  Employees at the top of their pay range are not eligible for special merit increases.  It is used to recognize and reward exceptionally outstanding performance or address a significant equity issue for meritorious employees.  Because these increases are intended for exceptional cases, it is expected that only a few will be submitted from each vice presidential area each year. A letter or memo of justification from the dean, department or unit head must be submitted to the Human Resources Classification & Compensation ( hrclasscomp@uoregon.edu ) that clearly outlines the extraordinary circumstances warranting the request and provides concrete examples of exceptional performance. The employee must have received and have on file a performance evaluation from their most recent merit increase date and have an accurate updated position description. If salary equity is a reason, relevant salary information must be included.  After review, the request will be forwarded to the appropriate vice president for approval.
