Billing Insurance Well-Being About Secondary Menu Immunization Requirements TB Risk Assessment Insurance Requirements Immunization Requirements for Students Vaccines are powerful tools for ensuring the health of a campus population. They help prevent certain communicable diseases that college students are prone to during their time on campus, including measles, mumps, rubella; chickenpox; tuberculosis; whooping cough; meningitis; COVID-19; and influenza. Students are encouraged to satisfy UO immunization requirements before arriving on campus. University Health Services can also administer all of the required and highly recommended vaccines to students. Please see Costs for Services for vaccine prices at UHS. Immunization for measles is required by the State of Oregon. See the Oregon Health Authority's "Vax to School" brochure (PDF) and immunization resources webpage to learn more about vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases. Required Vaccines for Students Vaccine Proof of Immunization Required Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) * Two doses of the MMR vaccine or two doses of individual measles and mumps vaccines and one dose of rubella vaccine; first dose of MMR or individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines on or after age 1—OR—titer (blood test) showing immunity—OR—birthdate prior to 1957 Meningococcal quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) (MCV4, MPSV4) One dose on or after age 16 for all students who are under 22 years of age Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) One dose on or after age 11 (note: Td does NOT satisfy the requirement) Varicella (chickenpox) Two doses; first dose on or after age 1—OR—physician documentation of disease—OR—titer (blood test) showing immunity * A hold will be placed on the registration process of students who are not compliant with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) requirements (see above).

For domestic students who are US citizens, the hold will be placed when registering for their second term. Individuals are able to request vaccine exemptions on the myUOHealth portal . Highly Recommended Vaccines for Students While not required, the following vaccines are also recommended: COVID-19 vaccine — up to date; Meningococcal B series completion; Hepatitis A and hepatitis B series completion; Human papillomavirus (HPV) series completion (three doses); Influenza vaccine (annual); Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) [for students with certain medical conditions. e.g., severe asthma, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease (please check with your clinician if uncertain)]. Submitting Documentation Submit your immunization record through the myUOHealth student portal. To login to myUOHealth: User ID is your Duck ID—the University of Oregon email address. Password is your email password. Enter the dates of your vaccines in "Immunization" tab. Note that the dates you submit will not be saved unless you upload your immunization records (see #3–5 below). Click "Submit" only when you are finished entering all the required immunization dates. Go to the "Upload" tab and choose "Immunization Record or Titer Results" from the menu. Click on the "Select File" button and navigate to the file to upload. If you only have one document that represents all the dates, that is acceptable. You do not need a document for each date you entered. Please combine (merge) images into one document and make sure your name and date of birth are on your immunization records before uploading. Important: You must upload your immunization record(s) in order to submit the dates of your vaccines and be considered compliant with UO immunization requirements. Note that MacBook images are not accepted by our system at this time; please use another device to upload images. If you have difficulties accessing the myUOHealth portal, you may submit your immunization record by mail, email, or fax. Send information to: University Health Services Immunization Compliance Coordinator 1232 University of Oregon, 1590 E. 13th Avenue Eugene, OR  97403-1232 Email: immunization@uoregon.edu Fax: 844-965-9250 Any testing performed internationally requires results translated into English before submission. If you need to request records from a health care provider, use the release of information form to do so. You may complete this form and submit it directly to your healthcare provider or school, which will give them permission to send the information directly to University Health Services. If you are unable to provide proof of immunity to any or all of these diseases, you will be required to have either a blood test to measure your immunity (called a titer), or receive the vaccines. Complete the certificate of immunization status with the assistance of your health care provider, or University Health Services can perform blood titers and administer the vaccines. About Exemptions/Waivers Immunization requirements may be waived for students for medical or non-medical reasons. Please be aware that, based on guidance from public health authorities, students who waive vaccine requirements may be excluded from campus for some disease outbreaks. Waivers for Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR); Varicella; Tdap; or Meningococcal (MenACYW) Vaccines To request a medical waiver for measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); varicella; Tdap; or meningococcal (MenACYW) vaccines, submit a letter signed by a licensed physician stating: Student’s name Birth date Medical condition that contraindicates vaccine(s) Approximate time until condition resolves, if applicable Physician’s signature and date Physician’s contact information, including phone number Students may submit a medical waiver to the immunization compliance coordinator, via the myUOHealth Portal (using the “Upload” tab). To request a non-medical waiver for measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); varicella; Tdap; or meningococcal (MenACYW) vaccines, students must be counseled by a health care professional, either their own or one at University Health Services.
