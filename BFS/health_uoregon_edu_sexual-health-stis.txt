Billing Insurance Well-Being About Secondary Menu Primary Care Acute Care Sports Medicine Specialty Care Lab and X-ray Sexual Health: Sexually Transmitted Infections I am having symptoms and I’m concerned about an STI. If you are experiencing symptoms, schedule an appointment in primary care or acute care for a diagnostic evaluation. All STIs are treatable, and the majority are curable. See information about specific STIs below for more guidance. I am not having symptoms but want to be screened for STIs. The STI Screening and Sexual Well-Being Clinic at University Health Services is a convenient way for students to get screened for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Screening tests are for those who have no symptoms. If you have symptoms (such as pain, urinary symptoms, abnormal discharge, rash, etc.), then you will need a diagnostic test, not a screening test. You can schedule this appointment with a UHS provider in primary care or acute care. If you are not having symptoms, then the STI Screening and Sexual Well-Being Clinic is a quick and easy way to get informed, protected, and tested. The clinic also offers sexual health supplies and a place to ask questions and get answers without judgment. In addition, we are committed to gender-neutral care both in the clinic and with our education materials . You will be notified of your screening results within one to three days, depending on the test. We generally relay negative results via your myUOHealth student portal and positive results with a personal phone call. For any positive test, we’ll arrange treatment for you. Screening is available for the following STIs: Chlamydia Gonorrhea HIV Syphilis Hepatitis B and C Following CDC recommendations, we provide screening for these six infections because: They often have no symptoms. There are good, inexpensive, and safe tests available. If found to be positive, the infection can be treated, which will have a positive impact both on your health and the health of the community. Health insurance usually covers costs associated with STI testing , depending on your plan. Please note, however, that some plans may list the lab screenings in a benefit statement, which could be mailed home to a parent or guardian. If you want to be certain that your charges remain confidential, you may pay cash for the visit and tests. How long until STI screening tests turn positive? How long until STI symptoms might show up? The time between infection and a positive test, or between infection and symptoms, is variable and depends on many factors, including the behavior of the infectious agent, how and where the body is infected, and the state of a person’s immune system and personal health. Many STIs don’t have any symptoms. The incubation period times listed in the chart below are averages only. If you have further questions or concerns, you can schedule an appointment with a provider at 541-346-2770.
