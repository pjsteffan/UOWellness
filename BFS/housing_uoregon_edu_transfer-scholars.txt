The Transfer Scholars Residential Community (RC) is designed for University of Oregon students transferring from another institution, seeking a supportive environment with peers who share similar experiences. This community offers dedicated resources and support tailored to the transfer student experience. Why should I choose to live in this community? Our Transfer Scholars RC provides UO transfer students with greater access to classes, faculty, academic support, and learning spaces, elevating the traditional transfer student. These resources are directly linked to increased academic achievement and overall well-being among college students. Yasui Hall, featuring apartment-style accommodations, offers a more independent experience while maintaining a centralized hub for community engagement, events, and resource accessibility. What are the community expectations? There are no classes associated with this community. Residents in this community will live in our apartment-style rooms with other Transfer Scholar members in Yasui Hall. To maximize the benefits of this community, students should expect to attend advising sessions and community events hosted in the Transfer Scholars RC pod on the first floor. Location Residence Hall: Yasui Hall . Students living in this community will select roommates who are also in the community. Please note that communities can be moved to different residence halls if the size or need of the community changes. For more information, contact arcs@uoregon.edu . Who is eligible and how do I apply? Students who are designated as transfer students who are coming to the UO from another institution are eligible to join the Transfer Scholars community. Register for University Housing and select the community you prefer in the "Community Preference" section. Answer the community questions on your housing registration.
