Oregon Paid Family and Medical Leave serves most employees in Oregon by providing paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child, an employee's or a loved one's serious illness, or if an employee experiences sexual assault, domestic violence, harassment, or stalking. The University of Oregon's program is administered by The Standard. Visit the Oregon Paid Family and Medical Leave webpage for more information.

Days of paid sick leave count toward the 16 weeks of unpaid Family and Medical Leave, except in the case of parental leave ( Article 29, Section 8 ). In cases where such leave is five (5) weeks or longer in a single term, such leave may be taken in conjunction with an academic leave of absence. Additional information regarding benefits retention, job protection, and academic leave of absence can be found in the Family and Medical Leave article in the CBA .
