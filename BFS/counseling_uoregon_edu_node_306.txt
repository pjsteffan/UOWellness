I use a variety of therapeutic approaches in a non-judgmental and welcoming setting to support clients with improving their mental health and overall well-being. I work collaboratively with individuals using a strengths-based perspective and incorporating body-centered techniques. I enjoy teaching and incorporating mindfulness and relaxation into my practice with students. In that past I’ve helped individuals work through depression, anxiety, stress, trauma recovery, and other complex needs in relation to behavioral and emotional regulation. I work to help develop and effectively implement coping skills to address realistic goals and achievable progress.
