What is the Gender Expansive Community? The Gender Expansive Community is for students who are committed to gender inclusion and centers trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, agender, gender queer, gender questioning and students with gender expansive identities and experiences. Residents in this community can choose to share a room with a student of any gender identity or sex. While the Gender Expansive Community is primarily a residential community, University Housing also offers an LGBTQIA+ Scholars Academic Residential Community, which focuses on shared coursework, academics, and scholarship centered on LGBTQIA+ identities and studies. What are the community expectations? Respect individuals’ pronouns, gender, and sexuality. Bring openness to cultivate a community of respect and community care. Reflect on how your identities (race, sexuality, disability, etc.) intersect with your gender and influence your experience. Attend one community program per term.
