RTO packets are eventually forwarded to University HR Operations for review. The RTO is used to set up or update the job record in Banner and to create a Notice of Appointment that is shared with the employee. Request Access to Banner screen PWAAPPT To access PWAAPPT, you must be an authorized Banner user. Banner access and authorization may be requested from the Business Affairs Office using the FIS/HRIS/AR User Profile form. This form is also used to request access to other areas in Banner if you are already an authorized Banner user. Begin or Continue RTO Entry PWAAPPT immediately takes you to the âKey Blockâ for an appointment number. If you would like to create a new RTO (including renewals and revisions), leave the appointment number field blank or clear the field if it is not blank. The system will assign a unique RTO number as you advance to the next block. If you would like to access an existing RTO (to see what was done before or to complete an unfinished RTO), enter the number into the appointment number field and advance to the next block. If you donât know the appointment number, click on the three dots to search for it. You can search based on any of the elements shown. Gather Needed Information to Begin Before you start a new RTO, be sure to have the following information at your fingertips: Employeeâs UO ID Number Position Number For all current UO employees, check PWIVERI to make sure your appointment will not conflict with other appointments the employee may have Contract Dates Timesheet Organization Number Enter Required Data Once you have navigated from the appointment number block to the next block, you are in the first of eight tabbed screens in the appointment system. The tabs are located across the top of the block. Depending on your level of authorization, all or some tabs will be accessible to you. There is also âToolsâ pull-down menu that allows you to do a variety of things with the RTO. Enter all required fields on each tab that is accessible to you. As you move from tab to tab, save the information by clicking the Save button or hitting the F10 key. You can partially prepare an RTO, save the information, and come back to it later. The following links will take you to detailed information about each tab: Appointment Person Pay Tenure Comments AAEO Log Status Complete the RTO Once you are satisfied that the RTO is correct and complete, print out the RTO by choosing âPrint RTOâ from the Tools menu. Select âDepartment Closeâ from the Tools menu. This action updates the Log Tab and prevents the department from making further changes. The RTO will always be available for you to view. Remember to Save before exiting. Submit the RTO Packet Assemble any needed supporting documentation to submit with the completed RTO. The HR: Request to Offer Upload form requires the following documents: RTO PDF printed from Banner Any approved extensions (like a Pro Tem Ongoing form) and a CV or resume On the HR: Request to Offer Upload form the department head/principal investigator and dean/director should be approvers. Once these signatures are complete, the form will go to University Human Resources, then to the Appointment Approver, and finally to Payroll. University Human Resources reviews the paperwork and issues a Notice of Appointment using the information on the RTO form. Once it is fully processed then employee will receive the Notice of Appointment via DuckWeb . Additional Actions Cancel an Appointment If an RTO needs to be canceled prior to the Notice of Appointment being issued, please notify University HR Operations. If it is necessary to cancel an appointment after the Notice of Appointment has been printed (as indicated on the Log Tab), notify both Payroll and University HR Operations. In both situations an email explanation is sufficient.
