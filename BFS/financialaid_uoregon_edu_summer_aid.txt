To be eligible, you must be admitted to the University of Oregon and enrolled in a degree or eligible certificate program. If you are a continuing student, you must be in good academic standing to receive financial aid. To Receive Summer Financial Aid 2024 Complete the FAFSA Summer term is part of the 2023-24 academic year and you must complete a 2023-24 FAFSA if you have not done so already. Note last day to complete the 2023–24 FAFSA is June 30, 2024. Register Initial registration for summer begins May 6, 2024 . Register for all of your classes by May 15 to receive your aid in a timely manner. Changes to your enrollment after May 15 may affect your eligibility for aid. After May 15 we will continue to make offers of financial aid for students that register later and/or complete the 2023-24 FAFSA. Note the last day to complete the 2023–24 FAFSA is June 30, 2024. We cannot guarantee availability of all funding sources after May 15 for students that have not registered for all of their classes or our office has not yet received a 2023-2024 FAFSA. Note, most summer financial aid requires at least half time enrollment which is a minimum of: 6 credits for undergraduates 5 credits for graduates 3 credits for law students Let Us Know If You are receiving any scholarships summer term You will be studying abroad and will want your budget increased because your parent will take out a PLUS loan for summer You will be living with your parent this summer Impacts of Dropping Classes If you drop a class(es) before it begins it will likely negatively impact your financial aid eligibility. If you drop below half time enrollment before seating in all of your classes, you may lose all of your financial aid for summer term. Dropping a class at any time may impact your current eligibility as well as your eligibility for aid in future terms if you do not make satisfactory academic progress. It is recommended you speak with a financial aid counselor if you are considering dropping a class during summer term.
