Prior to July 1, 2021, there was a limit on the maximum period of time that a student could receive Direct Subsidized Loans.  In general, a student could not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150% of the published length of their program.  Students could also lose their interest subsidy if they continue to be enrolled in any undergraduate program after receiving receiving Direct Subsidized Loans for their maximum eligibility period. More details surrounding time limitation on Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for first-time borrowers on or after July 1, 2013 can be found on this webpage. The U.S. Department of Education repealed this limitation. The repeal will apply to any borrower who receives a Direct Loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 2021, regardless of the award year associated with the loan. In addition, all lost subsidy benefits, if applicable, will be reinstated retroactively to the date on which the loss of subsidy was applied for all Federal Direct Stafford Subsidized Loans with an outstanding balance on July 1, 2021, and for all award years since the 2013-14 award year, which was when the SULA requirement was first implemented. *NOTE: If you received a Direct Subsidized Loan that was first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, you will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during your grace period. If you choose not to pay the interest that accrues during your grace period, the interest will be added to your principal balance.
