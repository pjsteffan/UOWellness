For this reason, you must consider whether your unit is anticipating an ongoing need for a position beyond the third year of hire, as Pro Tem appointments are limited to up to three years. Third Year Pro Tem Guidance Instructional Pro Tems Option 1. Conduct a Career Faculty Search to Fill the former Pro Tem Position For ongoing positions, the primary goal is to ensure we have the best possible faculty, which typically requires completing a fully competitive, targeted, national search. For this reason, if you anticipate your unit will have an ongoing need for this non-funding contingent position beyond the current year, we encourage you to consider a national search. To consult about streamlining career faculty searches, you can reach out to your unit's assigned recruiter in Human Resources' Talent Acquisition team by emailing talent@uoregon.edu . Option 2. Petition for Ongoing, Long term Pro Tem Position In the case of an instructional position, if the pedagogical or programmatic needs of your unit are best served by a professional in the field, Article 15, section 6 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between United Academics and the UO, makes allowances for this. The Provost or their designee may designate an "Ongoing, Long-term Pro Tem" position. Reasons for ongoing pro tem positions include when a department or unit: Believes the student experience is enhanced by having new instructors cycle into the program to meet specific needs; Identifies a position that is best taught by a working or retired professional in the industry and the position includes not more than three courses per year; Offers recent PhD graduates a short term position and there is an expectation that a new person will fill this position every one to three years; When traditionally large fluctuations in enrollment can be best accommodated by having a reasonable number of ongoing pro tem positions. Inadequate or limited financial resources are not legitimate pedagogical or programmatic reasons for designating a position as an ongoing long term pro tem position. Under the current terms of the hiring freeze, exceptions are required only for pro tem hires outside of the current term. If you plan to exercise option 2 , the petition forms can be found on the HR website. The petition for an ongoing long term pro tem must be accompanied by the faculty member's cv or resumes and then submitted along with the Request to Offer (RTO). Option 3. Petition for an exception to add one additional 4th year as Pro Tem Please note: Pro tems who were extended last year for a fourth year will not be extended again; units will instead need to conduct a career search or petition for ongoing, long term pro tem position as outlined in Options 1 and 2 above. If you plan to exercise option 3 , the petition forms can be found on the HR website . The petition for an additional year can be submitted along with the Request to Offer (RTO). If you believe the position should be converted to career classification, please see Other Options below. Research Funding Contingent Pro Tems Option 1. Reclassify the Position to a Career Faculty Position Reclassification of funding contingent positions does not require approval prior to initiating any changes. If your unit does reclassify the pro tem position to a career faculty position, you may either perform a new targeted, fully competitive national search or reclassify the current incumbent into the career position. The goal is to hire the best possible candidate. If you are reclassifying the position to a career position, please notate that in the internal comments on the renewal Request to Offer (RTO) form as submit it as usual Option 2. Petition for an Exception for one additional year as a Pro Tem (rare) If your department or unit foresees a need for continuing this position in the pro tem category, it is permissible in rare cases for the department or unit to petition the Vice Presidne for Research and Innovation or designee to continue the psoitin in the pro tem classification for up to one year beyond the three year limit for unusual or extenuating circumstances. If you plan to exercise option 2 , the petition forms can be found on the HR website. The petition for an additional year can be submitted along with the Request to Offer (RTO). Other Options Departments may petition the Office of the Provost to reclassify a bargaining unit faculty member into a career position when their employment has evolved to resemble a career classification more closely and there is an ongoing need for the position. After approval from the Office of the Provost to reclassify the bargaining unit faculty member, the Department would work with University HR Talent on a direct appointment in MyTrack. Alternatively, bargaining unit faculty members in the pro tem, visiting, or postdoctoral scholar classifications who believe that their positions should be in the Career classification may petition the Office of the Provost for reclassification after the completion of two years of appointment.
