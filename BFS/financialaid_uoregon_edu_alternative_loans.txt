Important facts about alternative loans to keep in mind include: The amount borrowed cannot exceed your cost of attendance minus other financial aid. These loans are primarily used to supplement the federal programs when federal aid and scholarships do not meet the cost of attendance. Alternative loans are based on a student’s credit history and often require a cosigner. These loans cannot be certified across academic years (summer is the last term of any academic year at the UO).
