Connect with one another . Prioritize communication . Seek out professional growth opportunities. Find work-life balance . Take care of yourself and encourage others to do the same . Take the lead in your own engagement . 1. Promote a recognition-rich work environment. One of the most important influencers of job satisfaction and connection at work is giving and receiving recognition. Employees not only want to feel valued and appreciated by their supervisor but also by their co-workers. Usually people think of recognition coming from their supervisor, but positive feedback from peers can be just as powerful. Peer-to-peer recognition creates an atmosphere of gratitude that strengthens and builds relationships. It also cultivates a culture of appreciation so that recognition starts to flow in all directions, across departments and locations, even up and down the reporting structure. Recognizing the work and contributions of co-workers does not have to be anything grand or given in the presence of others. Take time to honor, support, and encourage one another for big acheivements and the less obvious ones that others may overlook. Consider finding ways every day to say thank you and to brighten someone's day by making them feel seen and valued. A simply moment of kindness and appreciation may be just what someone needs to get through a rough moment and find motivation to keep going.
