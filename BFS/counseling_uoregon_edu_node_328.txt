My professional journey is guided by a deep commitment to the well-being of all students, with a particular focus on the welfare of Native American students. I firmly believe that understanding and nurturing their ecological systems play a critical role in their mental well-being and their retention rates on college campuses. In addition to my commitment to student well-being, I am deeply passionate about intercultural communication. It is a powerful tool for bridging gaps and fostering understanding among diverse communities. This passion drives me to continuously explore new ways to promote meaningful dialogues and connections between individuals from various backgrounds.
