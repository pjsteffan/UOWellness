When to use: Direct appointments may be used in the following situations: Note: Generally, the unit/department does intend to backfill position (if person who is directly appointed is an internal candidate). OA Re-employment Pool Where a candidate is a current or former university employee who is listed in the re-employment pool, typically as a result of job elimination. For information about accessing the OA re-employment pool, visit the instructions for hiring managers page . Contractual Obligations Individuals specified in grants, other employment contract, or permitted with a new employee offer letter. Individuals specifically named by Principal Investigators in grants or contracts may be hired without conducting a competitive search.  Other positions funded by research grants and contracts shall be filled according to university recruitment procedures. Individuals critical to the ongoing work of a new employee may be hired without a search where the new employee, as part of his/her employment contract negotiations, requests and receives appropriate approval to hire those individuals.  The appropriate Vice President or designee must approve such hires prior to the extension of the letter of offer (e.g., a new faculty member moving his/her research team, with uniquely relevant knowledge and experience, from another institution). Partner Hire An individual who is the spouse or partner of a new employee may be hired through the dual-career program without a search where that employment was negotiated by the new employee as part of his/her employment contract negotiations.  This requires appropriate Vice President or designee approval of the spouse or partner hiring agreement prior to the extension of the letter of offer. Failed Search If a search conducted within the last six months has failed to identify a qualified pool of candidates and/or all qualified candidates declined the position, an individual known to meet the needs of the position may be hired where failure to fill the position will compromise the operations of the unit. If this individual is a current employee and there are multiple similarly situated or qualified, potentially interested individuals within the unit, the unit should consider conducting an internal search unless the prior search was open to such individuals. University Mission-Critical Need Target of opportunity hires: a known external candidate who possesses unique skills, knowledge, and abilities that are beneficial to the university may be hired without a search in exceptional circumstances (e.g., a world renowned expert whose work is relevant to the academic program or other university strategic initiative). Non-competitive promotions of current employees: if aligned with a current university mission-critical strategic initiative, direct appointment of current employees to new positions may be considered. Promotions that include movement of a position from classified to unclassified status may require notice to the union in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. Process: Unit/Department will submit an updated position description via MyTrack and follow the position description approval process. HR review in MyTrack: FLSA status (exempt or nonexempt), classification status, compensation band, salary commensurate with new position, and ensure the position’s responsibilities align with the requirements listed in the position description. Unit/Department will create a requisition via MyTrack. Select “Direct Appointment” as the recruitment reason and select the appropriate Direct Appointment type from the following choices: OA Re-employment Pool Contractual Obligation Partner Hire Previous Failed Search University Mission Critical, Strategic Initiative Hires or Promotions Unit/Department will complete and upload the Request for Direct Appointment form in the documents tab on the requisition and submit through the requisition approval process. HR will review the updated position description and all additional submitted information to ensure that a Direct Appointment is appropriate. If it is not deemed appropriate, HR will contact the Unit/Department contact designated on the form to discuss other options and the Direct Appointment process will end. HR will review the requisition and create a hidden job link. HR will provide the link and instructions to the person being appointed, who will need to use the link to complete an application via MyTrack. Unit/Department completes offer card via MyTrack. HR will initiate exceptions approval process. See below for details. For OA partner hires of faculty, unit/department submits form to Provost’s Office for processing and approval of special funding sources; HR will consult on OA partner hires to ensure position description is appropriate for committed salary and will assign the appropriate compensation band. Note : In most cases, increases will be effective only prospectively, beginning the pay period following HR’s receipt of the request with unit based approvals using the appropriate mechanism for the pay action (e.g. submission via the MyTrack requisition process or PRF). Exception approval required if: For internal or external staff appointments, OA partner hires of OA’s or OA contractual obligation hires, VPFA must approve, in consultation with CHRO. For OA partner hires of faculty, Provost must approve, in consultation with CHRO. Certain positions in Athletics (coaches with individually negotiated agreements) will also require Presidential approval. Lack of alignment with VP/Dean on compensation band or salary will require approval of Provost (faculty serving in administrative roles) or VPFA (OAs) in consultation with CHRO. Lack of alignment regarding technical components of position (FLSA status, classification status and classification) will be determined by CHRO.
