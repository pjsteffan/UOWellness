Students who receive nonpassing grades (F, N, W, or X) at the University of Oregon may be required to prove participation to maintain their financial aid eligibility. Proof of Participation Since F, N, W and X grades do not confirm participation, students who receive these grades are required to prove participation. Proof of participation may include , but is not limited to: a statement from the instructor detailing your participation in the course and/or a printout from Canvas showing grades earned in the course, such as an academic assignment, quiz, or exam. Proof of participation does not include : living in institutional housing, participating in the school's meal plan, logging into an online class without active participation, or participating in academic counseling or advisement. Loss of Eligibility If no proof is provided by the deadline established by the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships, eligibility for federal financial aid will be revised. Where appropriate, the funds will then be returned to the federal student aid programs, and the student will have a bill at the University of Oregon.
